<p>(d) Consider a section of the figure, consisting of all points \((x,y)\) in the figure with \(b\le x\le c\text{,}\) and its “mirror” section on the other side of the line \(x=a\text{.}\) These two sections, which are drawn in red in the sketches below, will have the same area, at the same distance from \(x=a\text{.}\) Since we only care about the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of mass, it doesn't matter that the two halves are at different \(y\)-coordinates. The centre of mass falls along the line \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>
