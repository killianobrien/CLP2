<p>If the rate of introduction of error were exactly \(\varepsilon\text{,}\) we would have \(\frac{\text{actual error at }t=t_f}{\varepsilon t_f}=1\text{.}\) There is a small square on the graph for each different pair \(\varepsilon,t_f\text{.}\) So for each value of \(t_f\) there are ten (possibly overlapping) squares on the line \(x=t_f\text{.}\) This numerical experiment suggests that \(\frac{\text{actual error at }t=t_f}{\varepsilon t_f}\) is relatively independent of \(\varepsilon\) and starts, when \(t_f\) is small, at about one, as we want, but grows (perhaps exponentially) with \(t_f\text{.}\)</p>
