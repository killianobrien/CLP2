<p>Imagine \(S\) were a solid, of constant density. The the mass of a portion of \(S\) is proportional to the area of that portion. To find the \(x\)-coordinate where the solid would balance, we imagine compressing together the vertical dimension of \(S\) until it's a rod. That is, we would take a very thin vertical strip of \(S\text{,}\) and turn it into a small segment of a rod, with the same mass. Then the centre of mass of that rod would be exactly the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of mass of the solid — that is, the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid of \(S\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The compressed rod we form in this way is exactly \(R\) (perhaps multiplied by a constant, to account for the density of \(S\text{,}\) but this doesn't affect where \(R\) balances). So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid has the same position as the centre of mass of \(R\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Our result from Question <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_rod.html" title="Exercise 2.3.3.8">8</a>(<a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_rodb.html" title="Item 2.3.3.8.b">b</a>) tells us the centre of mass of \(R\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
&amp; \frac{\int_a^b x\textcolor{red}{\rho(x)}\,\dee{x}}{\int_a^b\textcolor{red}{\rho(x)}\,\dee{x}}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">In (c), we found \(\rho(x)=T(x)-B(x)\text{.}\) So, for  the solid \(S\) bounded by \(T(x)\) and \(B(x)\) on the interval \([a,b]\text{,}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
\bar x&amp;=\frac{\int_a^b x(\textcolor{red}{T(x)-B(x)})\,\dee{x}}{\int_a^b(\textcolor{red}{T(x)-B(x)})\,\dee{x}}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Remark: the denominator is the area of \(S\text{.}\) This formula is the same as the formula found in Equation <a knowl="./knowl/eq_TRQcentroid.html" title="Equation 2.3.5: Centroid of object with constant density">2.3.5</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-16.html#li-1746">in-context</a></span>
