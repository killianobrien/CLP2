<body><span class="footnote">Approximating the area in this way leads to a definition of integration that is called Riemann integration. This is the most  commonly used approach to integration. However we could also approximate the  area by using long thin horizontal strips. This leads to a definition of  integration that is called Lebesgue integration. We will not be covering  Lebesgue integration in these notes.</span></body>
