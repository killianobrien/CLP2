<p>A rock exerts a force of 1 N on the ground where it sits due to  gravity. Use \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>What is the mass of the rock?</p>
<p>How much work (in joules) does it take to lift that rock one metre in the air?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Consider the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_a^b F(x)\,\dee{x}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(x\) is measured in metres and \(F(x)\) is measured in kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons).</p>
<p>For some large \(n\text{,}\) we might approximate</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W \approx \sum_{i=1}^n F(x_i)\Delta x 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\) and \(x_i\) is some number in the interval \([a+(i-1)\Delta x, a+i\Delta x]\text{.}\) (This is just the general form of a Riemann sum).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>What are the units of \(\Delta x\text{?}\)</li>
<li>What are the units of \(F(x_i)\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Using your answers above, what are the units of \(W\text{?}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Remark: we already know the units of \(W\) from the text, but the Riemann sum illustrates <em class="emphasis">why they make sense</em> arising from this particular integral.</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>You want to weigh your luggage  before a flight. You don't have a scale or balance, but you do have a heavy-duty spring from your local engineering-supply store. You nail it to your wall, marking where the bottom hangs. You hang a one-litre bag of water (with mass one kilogram)  from the spring, and observe that the spring stretches 1 cm. Where on the wall should you mark the bottom of the spring corresponding to a hanging mass of 10kg?</p>

<p>You may assume that the spring obeys Hooke's law.</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The work done by a force in moving an object from position \(x = 1\) to \(x = b\) is \(W(b) = -b^3+6b^2-9b+4\) for any \(b\) in \([1,3]\text{.}\) At what position \(x\) in \([1,3]\) is the force the strongest?</p></article>
