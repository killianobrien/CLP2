<p>We get the relative sizes of the maxes and mins by eyeballing the area under \(y=f(t)\text{.}\) The first lobe (from \(x=0\) to \(x=1\) has a small positive area, so \(F(1)\) is a small positive number. The next lobe (from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\)) has a larger absolute area than the first, so \(F(3)\) is negative. Indeed, the second lobe seems to have more than twice the area of the first, so \(|F(3)|\) should be larger than \(F(1)\text{.}\) The third lobe is larger still, and even after subtracting the area of the second lobe it looks much larger than the first or second lobe, so \(|F(3)| \lt F(5)\text{.}\)</p>
