<p>A ball of mass \(m\) experiences a gravitational force of \(mg\text{,}\) so lifting it a height of \(\ell/2\) involves a work of \(\frac{1}{2}mg\ell\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The cable has density \(m/\ell\text{.}\) A tiny section of cable with length \(\dee{y}\) has mass \(\frac{m}{\ell}\,\dee{y}\text{,}\) and so gravity acts on it with a force of \(\frac{mg}{\ell}\,\dee{y}\text{.}\) If the tiny section of cable is \(y\) units from the top of the cable, it needs to be pulled up \(y\) units, so the work on that section is \(\frac{mg}{\ell}y\,\dee{y}\text{.}\) Therefore, the work to pull up the entire cable is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^\ell \frac{mg}{\ell}y\,\dee{y} = \left[\frac{mg}{2\ell}y^2\right]_0^\ell = \frac{mg}{2\ell}\ell^2 = \frac{1}{2}mg\ell
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, the work to pull up a cable with uniform density is the same as the work to pull up a ball with the same mass from the middle height of the cable.</p>
<p>Remark: this is a nice fact to use when you're checking your computations for “pulling up cable” problems, but keep in mind it depends on the cable being of uniform density.</p>
