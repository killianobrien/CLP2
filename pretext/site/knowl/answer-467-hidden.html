<p>(a) The strips between \(x=a\) and \(x=a'\) at the left end of the figure all have the same centre of mass, which is the \(y\)-value where \(T(x)=B(x)\text{,}\) \(x \lt 0\text{.}\) So, there should be multiple weights of different mass piled up at that \(y\)-value.</p>
<p>Similarly, the strips between \(x=b'\) and \(x=b\) at the right end of the figure all have the same centre of mass, which is the \(y\)-value where \(T(x)=B(x)\text{,}\) \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) So, there should be a second pile of weights of different mass, at that (higher) \(y\)-value.</p>
<p>Between these two piles, there are a collection of weights with identical mass distributed fairly evenly. The top and bottom ends of \(R\) (above the uppermost pile, and below the lowermost pile) have no weights.</p>
<p>One possible answer (using twelve slices):</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-403.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>(b) The area of the strip is \((T(x)-B(x))\,\dee{x}\text{,}\) and its centre of mass is at height \(\dfrac{T(x)+B(x)}{2}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>(c) \(\displaystyle\bar y=\frac{\int_a^b \big(T(x)^2-B(x)^2\big)\,\dee{x}}{2\int_a^b\big( T(x)-B(x)\big)\,\dee{x}}\)</p>
