<p>(a) If we were to set this figure on a pencil lined up along the vertical line \(x=a\text{,}\) it seems pretty clear that it would fall to the left. So, the centre of mass is to the left of the line \(x=a\text{.}\) The same is true in (b): the added density on the left makes it only more lopsided. However, in (c), the right side is denser than the left, which could counterbalance the left. Without knowing more about the dimensions and the density, we can't say where the centre of mass is in relation to the line \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>
