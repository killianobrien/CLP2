<p>Notice that, in this last example, we differentiated a known series to get  to our answer. As per Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_SRpsops.html" title="Theorem 3.5.13: Operations on Power Series">3.5.13</a>, the radius of convergence  didn't change. In addition, in this particular example, the interval  of convergence didn't change. This is not always the case. Differentiation of some series causes the interval of convergence to shrink.  In particular the differentiated series may no longer be convergent  at the end points of the interval <a knowl="./knowl/fn-190-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>. Similarly, when we integrate a power series the radius of convergence is  unchanged, but the interval of convergence may expand to include one or both ends, as illustrated by the next example.</p>
