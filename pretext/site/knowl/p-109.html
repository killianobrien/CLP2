<p>One of the main aims of this course is to build up general machinery for  computing  definite integrals (as well as interpreting and applying them). We shall start  on this  soon, but not quite yet. We have already seen one concrete, if laborious, method  for  computing definite integrals — taking limits of Riemann sums as we did in  Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_INTexparea.html" title="Example 1.1.1: Computing an area with vertical strips">1.1.1</a>. A second method, which will work for some special  integrands, works by interpreting the definite integral as “signed area”.  This  approach will work nicely when the area under the curve decomposes into simple  geometric  shapes like triangles, rectangles and circles. Here are some examples of this  second method.</p>
