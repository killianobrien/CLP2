<li>The denominators are successive powers of three, so one way of writing this is \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{3^i}\text{.}\) Equivalently, the terms we're adding are powers of \(1/3\text{,}\) so we can also write \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^i\text{.}\)</li>
<li>This sum is obtained from the sum in (a) by multiplying each term by two, so we can write \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{2}{3^i}\) or \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4 2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^i\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The difference between this sum and the previous sum is its alternating sign, minus-plus-minus-plus. This behaviour appears when we raise a negative number to successive powers. We can multiply each term by \((-1)^i\text{,}\) or we can slip a negative into the number that is already raised to the power \(i\text{:}\) \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4(-1)^i \frac{2}{3^i}\,,\) or \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4  \frac{2}{(-3)^i}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>This sum is the negative of the sum in part (c), so we can simply multiply each term by negative one: \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4(-1)^{i+1} \frac{2}{3^i}\) or \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4  -\frac{2}{(-3)^i}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Be careful with the second form: a common mistake is to think that \(-\dfrac{2}{(-3)^i} = \dfrac{2}{3^i}\text{,}\) but these are not the same.</p>
