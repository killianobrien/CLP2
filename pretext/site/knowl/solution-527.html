<p>(a) The values of the sequence seem to be getting closer and closer to -2, so we guess the limit of this sequence is -2.</p>
<p>(b) Overall, the values of the sequence seem to be getting extremely close to 0, so we approximate the limit of this sequence as 0. It doesn't matter that the sequence changes signs, or that the numbers are sometimes farther from 0, sometimes closer.</p>
<p>(c) This limit does not exist. The sequence is sometimes 0, sometimes -2, and not consistently staying extremely near to either one.</p>
