<body><span class="footnote">Don't attempt to attribute any special significance to the word “complex” in “complex number”, or to the word “real” in “real number” and “real part”, or to the word “imaginary” in “imaginary part”. All are <em class="emphasis">just names</em>. The name “imaginary” was introduced by René Descartes in 1637. René Descartes (1596–1650) was a French scientist and philosopher, who lived in the Dutch Republic for roughly twenty years after serving in the (mercenary) Dutch States Army. Originally, “imaginary” was a derogatory term and imaginary numbers were thought to be useless. But they turned out to be incredibly useful!</span></body>
