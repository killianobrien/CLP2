<body><span class="footnote">If the digits of \(\pi\) were to converge,  then \(\pi\) would have to be a rational number. The irrationality of \(\pi\)  (that it cannot be written as a fraction) was first proved by Lambert in 1761.  Niven's 1947 proof is more accessible and we invite the interested reader  to use their favourite search engine to find step-by-step guides to that proof.</span></body>
