<p>Suppose that we wish to generate an approximation to the initial value problem</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y'=f(t,y),\qquad
y(t_0)=y_0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for some range of \(t\)'s and we want the error introduced per unit increase<a knowl="./knowl/fn-268-hidden.html" title="Footnote D.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> of \(t\) to be no more than about some small fixed number \(\varepsilon\text{.}\) This means that if \(y_n\approx y(t_0+nh)\) and \(y_{n+1}\approx y(t+(n+1)h)\text{,}\) then we want the local truncation error in the step from \(y_n\) to \(y_{n+1}\) to be no more than about \(\varepsilon h\text{.}\) Suppose further that we have already produced the approximate solution as far as \(t_n\text{.}\) The rough strategy is as follows. We do the step from \(t_n\) to \(t_n+h\) twice using two different algorithms, giving two different approximations to \(y(t_{n+1})\text{,}\) that we call \(A_{1,n+1}\) and \(A_{2,n+1}\text{.}\) The two algorithms are chosen so that</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>we can use \(A_{1,n+1}-A_{2,n+1}\) to compute an approximate local truncation error and</li>
<li>for efficiency, the two algorithms use almost the same evaluations of \(f\text{.}\) Remember that evaluating the function \(f\) is typically the most time-consuming part of our computation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the event that the local truncation error, divided by \(h\text{,}\) (i.e. the error per unit increase of \(t\)) is smaller than \(\varepsilon\text{,}\) we set \(t_{n+1}=t_n+h\text{,}\) accept \(A_{2,n+1}\) as the approximate value<a knowl="./knowl/fn-269-hidden.html" title="Footnote D.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> for \(y(t_{n+1})\text{,}\) and move on to the next step. Otherwise we pick, using what we have learned from \(A_{1,n+1}-A_{2,n+1}\text{,}\) a new trial step size \(h\) and start over again at \(t_n\text{.}\)</p>
