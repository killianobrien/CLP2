<p>Let \(\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\) be a sequence defined by \(a_n = \cos n\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Give three different whole numbers \(n\) that are within 0.1 of an odd integer multiple of \(\pi\text{,}\) and find the corresponding values of \(a_n\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Give three different whole numbers \(n\) such that \(a_n\) is close to \(0\text{.}\) Justify your answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remark: this demonstrates intuitively, though not rigorously, why \(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\cos n\) is undefined. We consistently find terms in the series that are close to \(-1\text{,}\) and also consistently find terms in the series that are close to 1. Contrast this to a series like \(\big\{\cos(2\pi n)\big\}\text{,}\) whose terms are always 1, and whose limit therefore is 1. It is possible to turn the ideas of this question into a rigorous proof that \(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\cos n\) is undefined. See the solution.</p>
