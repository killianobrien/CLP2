<p>To find the limit, or show that it does not exist, we are going to have to exhibit a cancellation between the numerator  and the denominator. To develop a strategy for evaluating this limit, let's do a “little scratch work”, starting by  taking a closer look at the denominator. By Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_bigohlog.html" title="Example 3.6.29: Logarithms and the big O">3.6.29</a>,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\log(1+x) = x+O(x^2)
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>This tells us that \(\log(1+x)\) looks a lot like \(x\) for very small \(x\text{.}\) So the denominator \([x+O(x^2)]^4\) looks a lot like \(x^4\) for very small \(x\text{.}\) Now, what about the numerator?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If the numerator looks like some constant times \(x^p\) with \(p \gt 4\text{,}\)  for very small \(x\text{,}\) then the ratio will look like the constant times  \(\frac{x^p}{x^4}=x^{p-4}\) and, as \(p-4 \gt 0\text{,}\) will tend to \(0\) as \(x\)  tends to zero.</li>
<li>If the numerator looks like some constant times \(x^p\) with \(p \lt 4\text{,}\)  for very small \(x\text{,}\) then the ratio will look like the constant times  \(\frac{x^p}{x^4}=x^{p-4}\) and will, as \(p-4 \lt 0\text{,}\) tend to infinity,  and in particular diverge, as \(x\) tends to zero.</li>
<li>If the numerator looks like  \(Cx^4\text{,}\) for very small \(x\text{,}\) then  the ratio will look like \(\frac{Cx^4}{x^4}=C\) and will tend to \(C\) as  \(x\) tends to zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>The moral of the above “scratch work” is that we need to know the  behaviour of the numerator, for small \(x\text{,}\) up to order \(x^4\text{.}\) Any  contributions of order \(x^p\) with \(p \gt 4\) may be put into error  terms \(O(|x|^p)\text{.}\)</p>
