</h6>Robert Hooke (1635–1703) was an English contemporary of Isaac Newton (1643–1727). It was in a 1676 letter to Hooke that Newton wrote  “If I have seen further it is by standing on the  shoulders of Giants.” There is some  thought that this was sarcasm and Newton was actually making fun of Hooke,  who had a spinal deformity. However at that time Hooke and Newton were still friends.  Several years later they did have a somewhat public falling-out over some of Newton's work  on optics.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-30.html#fn-114">in-context</a></span>
