</h6>This is not a physics text so we will not be too precise. Roughly  speaking, kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to it being in motion, as  opposed to potential energy, which is the energy of the object due to its position in a  force field. Leibniz and Bernoulli determined that kinetic energy is proportional to the  square of the velocity, while the modern term “kinetic energy” was first used by Lord  Kelvin (back while he was still William Thompson).</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-30.html#fn-113">in-context</a></span>
