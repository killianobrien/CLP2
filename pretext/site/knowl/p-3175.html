<li>Now suppose that we wish to stretch out the spring so that its right hand end is at \(x=L\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Hooke's Law <a knowl="./knowl/fn-114-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> says that when a (linear) spring is stretched (or compressed) by \(x\) units beyond its natural length, it exerts a force of  magnitude \(kx\text{,}\) where the constant \(k\) is the spring constant of that spring.</li>
<li>In our case, once we have stretched the spring by \(x\) units to the right, the spring will be trying to pull back the right hand end by applying a force of magnitude \(kx\) directed to the left.</li>
<li>For us to continue stretching the spring we will have to apply a compensating force of magnitude \(kx\) directed to the right. That is, we have to apply  the force \(F(x) = +kx\text{.}\)</li>
<li>So to stretch a spring by \(L\) units from its natural length we have to supply the  work<div class="displaymath">

W &amp;=\int_0^L k x\dee{x} =\frac{1}{2}kL^2
