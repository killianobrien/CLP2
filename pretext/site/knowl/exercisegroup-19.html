<p>Suppose you want to evaluate an integral using integration by parts. You choose part of your integrand to be \(u\text{,}\) and part to be \(\dee{v}\text{.}\) The part chosen as \(u\) will be: (differentiated, antidifferentiated). The part chosen as \(\dee{v}\) will be: (differentiated, antidifferentiated).</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Let \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) be differentiable functions. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, give an equivalent expression to \(\displaystyle\int \frac{f'(x)}{g(x)}\dee{x}\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Suppose we want to use integration by parts to evaluate \(\displaystyle\int u(x)\cdot v'(x) \dee{x}\) for some differentiable functions \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\) We need to find an antiderivative of \(v'(x)\text{,}\) but there are infinitely many choices. Show that every antiderivative of \(v'(x)\) gives an equivalent final answer.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Suppose you want to evaluate \(\displaystyle\int f(x)\dee{x}\) using integration by parts. Explain why \(\dee{v} = f(x)\dee{x}\text{,}\) \(u=1\) is generally a bad choice.</p>
<p>Note: compare this to Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_PRTSlnx.html" title="Example 1.7.8: \(\int \log x\dee{x}\)">1.7.8</a>, where we chose \(u=f(x)\text{,}\) \(\dee{v}=1\dee{x}\text{.}\)</p></article>
