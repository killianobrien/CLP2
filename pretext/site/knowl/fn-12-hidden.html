<body><span class="footnote">Of course, any finite sum can be computed  exactly — just sum together the terms. What we mean by “computed exactly” in this  context, is that we can rewrite the sum as a simple, and easily  evaluated, formula involving the terminals of the sum. For example \(\sum_{k=m}^n r^k = \frac{r^{n+1}-r^m}{r-1}\) provided \(r\neq1\text{.}\) No matter what finite integers we choose for \(m\) and \(n\text{,}\) we can quickly compute the sum  in just a few arithmetic operations. On the other hand, the sums, \(\sum_{k=m}^n \frac{1}{k}\) and \(\sum_{k=m}^n \frac{1}{k^2}\text{,}\) cannot be expressed in such clean formulas (though you can rewrite them quite cleanly  using integrals). To explain more clearly we would need to go into a more detailed and  careful discussion that is beyond the scope of this course.</span></body>
