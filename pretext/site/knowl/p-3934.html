<p>The techniques of Section 2.1 get pretty complicated here, so we will use the techniques we developed in Questions <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3tank1.html" title="Exercise 2.3.3.6">6</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_cone.html" title="Exercise 2.3.3.29">29</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_cone2.html" title="Exercise 2.3.3.30">30</a> in this section. That is, (1) find the centre of mass of the water in its starting and ending positions, and then (2) compute the work done as the work moving a point mass with the weight of the water from the first centre of mass to the second. For the centre of mass, all we need to know is the height — for one thing, we could find the other coordinates by symmetry, but we don't need them. The height moved by the water is all that matters if we're calculating the work done opposing gravity.</p>
