<p>Suppose we have the following functions:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>\(y\) is a differentiable function of \(x\)</li>
<li>\(f\) is a function of \(x\text{,}\) with \(\int f(x)\,\dee{x}=F(x)\)</li>
<li>\(g\) is a nonzero function of \(y\text{,}\) with \(\int \frac{1}{g(y)} \,\dee{y}=G(y)=G(y(x))\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the work below, we set up a solution to the separable differential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{y}{x}=f(x)g(y)=f(x)g(y(x)))
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>without using the mnemonic of EquationÂ <a knowl="./knowl/eq_SDEbasicSln.html" title="Equation">(\(\star\))</a>.</p>
<p>By deleting some portion of our work, we can create the solution as it would look using the mnemonic. What portion can be deleted?</p>
<p>Remark: the purpose of this exercise is to illuminate what, exactly, the mnemonic is a shortcut for. Despite its peculiar look, it agrees with what we already know about integration.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><font color="blue"><div class="displaymath" id="p-4062">
\begin{align*}
\diff{y}{x}&amp;=f(x)g(y(x))\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">Since \(g(y(x))\) is a nonzero function, we can divide both sides by it.</p>
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{g(y(x))}\cdot\diff{y}{x}&amp;=f(x)\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">If these functions of \(x\) are the same, then they have the same antiderivative with respect to \(x\text{.}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{1}{g(y(x))}\cdot\diff{y}{x}\,\dee{x}&amp;=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">The left integral is in the correct form for a change of variables to \(y\text{.}\) To make this easier to see, we'll use a \(u\)-substitution, since it's a little more familiar than a \(y\)-substitution. If \(u=y\text{,}\) then \(\diff{u}{x}=\diff{y}{x}\text{,}\) so \(\dee{u}=\diff{y}{x}\dee{x}\text{.}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{1}{g(u)}\,\dee{u}&amp;=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">Since \(u\) was just the same as \(y\text{,}\) again for cosmetic reasons, we can swap it back. (Formally, you could have skipped the step above--we just included it to be extra clear that we're not using any integration techniques we haven't seen before.)</p>
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{1}{g(y)}\,\dee{y}&amp;=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">We're given the antiderivatives in question.</p>
\begin{align*}
G(y)+C_1&amp;=F(x)+C_2\\
G(y)&amp;=F(x)+(C_2-C_1)\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">where \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are arbitrary constants. Then also \(C_2-C_1\) is an arbitrary constant, so we might as well call it \(C\text{.}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
G(y)&amp;=F(x)+C
\end{align*}
