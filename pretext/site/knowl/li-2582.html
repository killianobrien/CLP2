<p>In the differential calculus text CLP-1, we treated only derivatives of functions of one variable. Such derivatives are called ordinary derivatives. A differential equation is called an <dfn class="terminology">ordinary differential equation</dfn> (often shortened to “ODE”) if only ordinary derivatives appear. That is, if the unknown function has only a single independent variable.</p>
<p>In CLP-3 we will treat derivatives of functions of more than one variable. For example, let \(f(x,y)\) be a function of two variables. If you treat \(y\) as a constant and take the derivative of the resulting function of the single variable \(x\text{,}\) the result is called the partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\text{.}\) A differential equation is called a <dfn class="terminology">partial differential equation</dfn> (often shortened to “PDE”) if partial derivatives appear. That is, if the unknown function has more than one independent variable. For example \(y''(t)+y(t)=0\) is an ODE while \(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial\, t^2}(x,t)=c^2
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial\, x^2}(x,t)\) is a PDE.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ssec_complex_de.html#li-2582">in-context</a></span>
