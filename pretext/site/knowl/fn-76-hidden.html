<body><span class="footnote">At the risk of quoting Nietzsche,  “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” Though this author always preferred  the logically equivalent contrapositive — “That which does not make us stronger will  kill us.” However no one is likely to be injured by practicing partial fractions or  looking up quotes on Wikipedia. Its also a good excuse to remind yourself of what a  contrapositive is — though we will likely look at them again when we get to  sequences and series.</span></body>
