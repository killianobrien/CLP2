</h6>The reader might ask whether or not we will give  the series for other trigonometric functions or their inverses. While  the tangent function has a perfectly well defined series, its  coefficients are not as simple as those of the series we have  seen — they form a sequence of numbers known (perhaps unsurprisingly)  as the “tangent numbers”. They, and the related Bernoulli numbers,  have many interesting properties, links to which the interested reader  can find with their favourite search engine. The Maclaurin series for  inverse sine is \(\arcsin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4^{-n}}{2n+1}\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} x^{2n+1}\) which is quite tidy, but proving it is beyond the scope of the course.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-56.html#fn-197">in-context</a></span>
