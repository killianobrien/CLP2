<p>Taylor series have a great many applications. (Hence their place in this  course.) One of the most immediate of these is that they give us an  alternate way of computing many functions. For example, the first  definition we see for the sine and cosine functions is in terms of  triangles. Those definitions, however, do not lend themselves to  computing sine and cosine except at very special angles. Armed with  power series representations, however, we can compute  them to very high precision at any angle. To illustrate this, consider the  computation of \(\pi\) â€” a problem that dates back to the Babylonians.</p>
