<p>Find a power series representation for \(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\text{.}\)</p>
<p><em class="alert">Solution:</em> The secret to finding power series representations for a good many functions is to manipulate them into a form in which \(\frac{1}{1-y}\) appears and use the geometric series representation  \(\frac{1}{1-y} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty y^n\text{.}\) We have deliberately renamed the variable to \(y\) here — it does not have to be \(x\text{.}\) We can use that strategy to find a power series expansion for \(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\) — we  just have to recognize that \(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\) is the same as  \(\frac{1}{1-y}\) if we set \(y\) to \(x^2\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-x^2} &amp;= \frac{1}{1-y}\bigg|_{y=x^2}
=\bigg[\sum_{n=0}^\infty y^n
\bigg]_{y=x^2}
\quad\text{if $|y| \lt 1$, i.e. $|x| \lt 1$}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\big(x^2\big)}^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{2n}\\
&amp;= 1+x^2+x^4+x^6  +\cdots\hskip-0.2in
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>This is a perfectly good power series. There is nothing wrong with the  power of \(x\) being \(2n\text{.}\) (This just means that the coefficients of all odd powers of \(x\) are zero.) In fact, you should try to always write power  series in forms that are as easy to understand as possible. The geometric  series that we used at the end of the first line converges for</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
|y| \lt 1  \iff  \big|x^2\big| \lt 1  \iff |x| \lt 1
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>So our power series has radius of convergence \(1\) and interval of convergence \(-1 \lt x \lt 1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-55.html#eg_SRpsrepAA">in-context</a></span>
