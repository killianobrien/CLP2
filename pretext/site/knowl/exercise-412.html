<p>A sculpture, shaped like a pyramid \(3\)m high sitting on the ground, has been made by stacking smaller and smaller (very thin) iron plates on top of one another. The iron plate at height \(z\) m above ground level is a square whose side length is \((3-z)\) m. All of the iron plates started on the floor of a basement \(2\) m below ground level.</p>
<p>Write down an integral that represents the work, in joules, it took to move all of the iron from its starting position to its present position. Do <em class="alert">not</em> evaluate the integral. (You can use \(9.8\) m\({}/{}\)s\({}^2\) for the acceleration due to gravity and \(8000\)  kg\({}/{}\)m\({}^3\) for the density of iron.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-14.html#exercise-412">in-context</a></span>
