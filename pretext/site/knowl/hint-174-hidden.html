<p>(a) Don't be put off by phrases like “rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.” This is the same kind of volume you've been calculating all section.</p>
<p>(b) Hopefully, you sketched the ellipse in part (a). What was its smallest radius? Its largest? These correspond to the polar and equitorial radii, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Combine your answers from (a) and (b).</p>
<p>(d) Remember that the absolute error is the absolute difference of your two results--that is, you subtract them and take the absolute value. The relative error is the absolute error divided by the actual value (which we're taking, for our purposes, to be your answer from (c)). When you take the relative error, lots of terms will cancel, so it's easiest to not use a calculator till the end.</p>
