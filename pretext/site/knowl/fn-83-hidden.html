<body><span class="footnote">We apologise for being a little sloppy  here â€” but we just want to say that it can be very hard or even impossible to write some  integrals as some finite sized expression involving polynomials, exponentials, logarithms  and trigonometric functions. We don't want to get into a discussion of computability,  though that is a very interesting topic.</span></body>
