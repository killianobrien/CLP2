<p>There is a key detail in the statement of Question <a knowl="./knowl/p1_1cartime.html" title="Exercise 1.1.8.34: (✳)">34</a>: namely, that the car is continuously accelerating. So, although we don't know exactly what's going on in between our brief snippets of information, we know that the car is not going any faster during an interval than at the end of that interval. Therefore, the car certainly travelled no farther than our estimation.</p>
