<p>The comparison test is Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_SRcomparisonTest.html" title="Theorem 3.3.8: The Comparison Test">3.3.8</a>. However, rather than trying to memorize which way the inequalities go in all cases, we  use the same reasoning as Question <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s3_3_oldies.html" title="Exercise 3.3.11.3">3</a>.</p>
<p>If a sequence has positive terms, it either converges, or it diverges to infinity, with the partial sums increasing and increasing without bound. If one sequence diverges, and the other sequence is larger, then the other sequence diverges — just like being older than an old person makes you old.</p>
<p>If \(\sum a_n\) converges, and \(\{a_n\}\) is the red (larger) series, then \(\sum b_n\) converges: it's smaller than a sequence that doesn't add up to infinity, so it too does not add up to infinity.</p>
<p>If \(\sum a_n\) diverges, and \(\{a_n\}\) is the blue (smaller) series, then \(\sum b_n\) diverges: it's larger than a sequence that adds up to infinity, so it too adds up to infinity.</p>
<p>In the other cases, we can't say anything. If \(\{a_n\}\) is the red (larger) series, and  \(\sum a_n\) diverges, then perhaps \(\{b_n\}\) behaves similarly to \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\sum b_n\) diverges, or perhaps \(\{b_n\}\) is much, much smaller than \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\sum b_n\) converges.</p>
<p>Similarly, if \(\{a_n\}\) is the blue (smaller) series, and  \(\sum a_n\) converges, then perhaps \(\{b_n\}\) behaves similarly to \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\sum b_n\) converges, or perhaps \(\{b_n\}\) is much, much bigger than \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\sum b_n\) diverges.</p>
