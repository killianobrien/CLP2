<body><span class="footnote">Awful pun. The two main approaches to statistics are  frequentism and Bayesianism; the latter named after Bayes' Theorem which is, in turn,  named for Reverend Thomas Bayes. While this (both the approaches to statistics  and their history and naming) is a very interesting and quite  philosophical topic, it is beyond the scope of this course. The interested reader has  plenty of interesting reading here to interest them.</span></body>
