<p>How should we parse the big O notation when we see it? Consider  the following</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
g(x) &amp;= O( |x-3|^2 )
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>First of all, we know from the definition that the notation only tells us something about \(g(x)\) for \(x\) near the  point \(a\text{.}\) The equation above contains “\(O(|x-3|^2)\)” which  tells us something about what the function looks like when \(x\)  is close to \(3\text{.}\) Further, because it is “\(|x-3|\)” squared,  it says that the graph of the function lies below a parabola \(y=C(x-3)^2\) and above a parabola \(y=-C(x-3)^2\) near \(x=3\text{.}\) The notation doesn't  tell us anything more than this — we don't know, for example,  that the graph of \(g(x)\) is concave up or concave down. It also  tells us that Taylor expansion of \(g(x)\) around \(x=3\) does not  contain any constant or linear term — the first nonzero term  in the expansion is of degree at least two.  For example, all of the  following functions are \(O(|x-3|^2)\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
5(x-3)^2 + 6(x-3)^3,\qquad
-7(x-3)^2 - 8(x-3)^4,\qquad
(x-3)^3,\qquad
(x-3)^{\frac{5}{2}}
\end{gather*}
</div>
