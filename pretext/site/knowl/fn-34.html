</h6>Recall that in most mathematics  courses (especially this one) we use \(\log x\) without any indicated base  to denote the natural logarithm — the logarithm base \(e\text{.}\)  Many widely used computer languages, like Java, C, Python, MATLAB, \(\cdots\text{,}\) use \(\log(x)\) to denote the logarithm base \(e\) too. But many texts also use \(\ln x\) to denote the natural logarithm \(\log x = \log_e x = \ln x.\) The reader should be comfortable with all three notations for this function. They should  also be aware that in different contexts — such as in chemistry or physics — it is  common to use \(\log x\) to denote the logarithm base 10, while in computer science often  \(\log x\) denotes the logarithm base 2. Context is key.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-10.html#fn-34">in-context</a></span>
