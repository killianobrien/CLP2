<body><div class="solution"><p>As in QuestionÂ <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_1_Work_KE.html" title="Exercise 2.1.2.18">18</a> in this section, the change in kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by the compressing struts. The only added step is to calculate the spring constant, given that a car with mass 2000 kg compresses the spring 2 cm in Earth's gravity. You're not calculating <em class="emphasis">work</em> to find the spring constant: you're using the fact that when the car is sitting still, the force exerted upward by the struts is equal to the force exerted downward by the mass of the car under gravity.</p></div></body>
