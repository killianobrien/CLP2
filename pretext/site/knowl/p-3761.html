<p>In our model, each of these strips corresponds to a weight on \(R\text{,}\) positioned at its centre of mass (the height of the dot), and with a mass equal to the strip's area. For the portion of \(S\) with \(a'\le x \le b'\text{,}\) each centre of mass is at a slightly different height, but the areas of the slices are the same. So, the corresponding weights along \(R\) are at different heights, but all have the same mass, as shown below. (Note the rod \(R\) below only contains the weights from the middle of \(S\) â€” we'll add the rest later.)</p>
