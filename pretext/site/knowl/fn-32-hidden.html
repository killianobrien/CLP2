<body><span class="footnote">This follows from the Mean Value Theorem. Say \(H(x)\) were not constant,  then there would be two numbers \(a \lt b\) so that \(H(a)\neq H(b)\text{.}\) Then the MVT tells us that  there is a number \(c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(H'(c) = \frac{H(b)-H(a)}{b-a}.\) Since both numerator and denominator are nonzero, we know the derivative at \(c\) is  nonzero. But this would contradict the assumption that derivative of \(H\) is zero. Hence  we cannot have \(a \lt b\) with \(H(a)\neq H(b)\) and so \(H(x)\) must be constant.</span></body>
