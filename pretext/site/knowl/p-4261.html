<p>Suppose that in a very short time interval \(\dee{t}\text{,}\) the height of water in the tank changes by \(\dee{h}\) (which is negative). Then in this time interval the amount of the water in the tank decreases by \(\dee{V}=-\pi(3)^2\dee{h}\text{.}\) This must be the same as the amount of water that flows through the hole in this time interval. The water flowing through the hole makes a cylinder of radius 1 cm (that is, 0.01 m) with length \(v(t)\dee{t}\text{,}\) the distance the water moves out of the hole in \(\dee{t}\) seconds. So, the amount of water leaving the hole over the time interval \(\dee{t}\) is  \(\pi(0.01)^2 v(t)\,\dee{t}
=\pi(0.01)^2 \sqrt{2gh(t)}\,\dee{t}\text{.}\)</p>
