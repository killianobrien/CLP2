<p>We ask this question in order to point out an important detail. If we did not have the information that the car was continuously accelerating, we would not be able to give a certain upper bound on its distance travelled. It would be possible that, when the car is not being observed (for example, when \(t=0.25\)), it is going much faster than when it is being observed.</p>
