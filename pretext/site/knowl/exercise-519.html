<p>An endowment is an investment account in which the balance ideally remains constant and withdrawals are made on the interest earned by the account. Such an account may be modeled by the initial value problem \(B'(t) = aB - m\) for \(t \ge 0\text{,}\) with \(B(0) = B_0\) . The constant \(a\) reflects the annual interest rate, \(m\) is the annual rate of withdrawal, and \(B_0\) is the initial balance in the account.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Solve the initial value problem with \(a = 0.02\) and \(B(0) = B_0 = \$30,000\text{.}\) Note that your answer depends on the constant \(m\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(a = 0.02\) and \(B(0) = B_0 = \$30,000\text{,}\) what is the annual withdrawal rate \(m\) that ensures a constant balance in the account?</li>
