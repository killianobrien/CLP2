<p>A box is dragged along the floor. Friction exerts a force in the opposite direction of motion from the box, and that force is equal to \(\mu \times m \times g\text{,}\) where \(\mu\) is a constant, \(m\) is the mass of the box and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. You may assume \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>How much work is done dragging a box of mass 10 kg along the floor for three metres if \(\mu=0.4\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Suppose the box contains a volatile substance that rapidly evaporates. You pull the box at a constant rate of 1 m/sec for three seconds, and the mass of the box at \(t\) seconds (\(0 \leq t \leq 3\)) is \((10-\sqrt{t})\) kilograms. If \(\mu=0.4\text{,}\) how much work is done pulling the box for three seconds?</li>
