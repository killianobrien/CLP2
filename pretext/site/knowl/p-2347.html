<p>By now the reader will have come to appreciate that integration is generally quite a bit  more difficult than differentiation. There are a great many simple-looking integrals,  such as \(\int e^{-x^2}\dee{x}\text{,}\) that are either very difficult or even impossible to  express in terms of standard functions <a knowl="./knowl/fn-83-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.11.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Such integrals are not merely mathematical  curiosities, but arise very naturally in many contexts. For example, the error function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\mathrm{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^x e^{-t^2}\dee{t}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>is extremely important in many areas of mathematics, and also in many practical  applications of statistics.</p>
