<p>In the previous section we explored the fundamental theorem of calculus and the link it  provides between definite integrals and antiderivatives. Indeed, integrals with simple  integrands are usually evaluated via this link. In this section we start to explore  methods for integrating more complicated integrals. We have already seen —  via Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_Intarith.html" title="Theorem 1.2.1: Arithmetic of Integration">1.2.1</a> — that integrals interact very nicely with  addition, subtraction and multiplication by constants:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int_a^b \left( Af(x) + B g(x) \right) \dee{x} &amp;= A\int_a^b f(x)\dee{x} + B\int_a^b g(x)\dee{x}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>for \(A,B\) constants. By combining this with the list of indefinite integrals in  Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_imp_indef_int.html" title="Theorem 1.3.17: Important indefinite integrals">1.3.17</a>, we can compute integrals of linear combinations of  simple functions. For example</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int_1^4\left(e^x - 2\sin x + 3x^2 \right)\dee{x} &amp;= \int_1^4e^x\dee{x} -2\int_1^4 \sin x \dee{x} +3 \int_1^4x^2 \dee{x}\\
&amp;= \left(e^x  + (-2)\cdot(-\cos x) + 3\frac{x^3}{3} \right)\bigg|_1^4  &amp;\text{and so on}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Of course there are a great many functions that can be approached in this way, however  there are some very simple examples that cannot.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int \sin(\pi x) \dee{x} &amp;&amp; \int x e^x \dee{x} &amp;&amp; \int \frac{x}{x^2-5x+6}\dee{x}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>In each case the integrands are not linear combinations of simpler functions; in order to  compute them we need to understand how integrals (and antiderivatives) interact with  compositions, products and quotients. We reached a very similar point in our differential  calculus course where we understood the linearity of the derivative,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\diff{}{x}\left(Af(x)+ Bg(x)\right) &amp;= A\diff{f}{x} + B\diff{g}{x},
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>but had not yet seen the chain, product and quotient rules <a knowl="./knowl/fn-37-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. While we will develop tools to find the second and third integrals in  later sections, we should really start with how to integrate compositions of functions.</p>
