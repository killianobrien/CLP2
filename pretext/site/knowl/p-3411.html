<p>It's not immediately clear which rule (Simpson's, midpoint, or trapezoidal) will lead us down the easiest path. For Simpson's rule, we need to know the fourth derivative of \(F(x)\text{,}\) which is not a simple task. But, we often need fewer intervals for Simpson's rule than for the midpoint or trapezoid rules. In this case, we'll show below that  \(n = 2\) intervals  suffice to guarantee a low enough error using the midpoint rule, so Simpson's rule won't let us get away with fewer intervals. Below, we find the approximation using the midpoint rule â€” but there are other ways as well.</p>
