<li>Two possible answers are \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=3}^7 i\) and \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^5 (i+2)\text{.}\) The first has simpler terms (\(i\) versus \(i+2\)), while the second has simpler indices (we often like to start at \(i=1\)). Neither is objectively better than the other, but  depending on your purposes you might find one more useful.</li>
<li>The terms of this sum are each double the terms of the sum from part (a), so two possible answers are \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=3}^7 2i\) and \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^5 (2i+4)\text{.}\) We often want to write a sum that involves even numbers: it will be useful for you to remember that the term  \(2i\) (with index \(i\)) generates evens.</li>
<li>
<p>The terms of this sum are each one more than the terms of the  sum from part (b), so two possible answers are \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=3}^7 (2i+1)\) and \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^5 (2i+5)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In the last part, we used the expression \(2i\) to generate even numbers; \(2i+1\) will generate odds. So will the index \(2i+5\text{,}\) and indeed, \(2i+k\) for any odd number \(k\text{.}\) The choice of what you add will depend on the bounds of \(i\text{.}\)</p>

<p>This sum adds up the odd numbers from 1 to 15. From  PartÂ (<a knowl="./knowl/p1_1sigma1c.html" title="Item 1.1.8.6.c">c</a>), we know that the formula \(2i+1\) is a simple way of generating odd numbers. Since our first term should be 1 and our last term should be 15, if we use \(\sum (2i+1)\text{,}\) then \(i\) should run from \(0\) to \(7\text{.}\) So, one way of expressing our sum in sigma notation is \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^7 (2i+1)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Sometimes we like our sum to start at \(i=1\) instead of \(i=0\text{.}\) If this is our desire, we can use \(2i-1\) as our terms, and let \(i\) run from 1 to 8. This gives us another way of expressing our sum: \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^8 (2i-1)\text{.}\)</p>
