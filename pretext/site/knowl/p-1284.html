<p>Two potters start with a block of clay \(h\) units tall, and identical square cookie cutters. They form columns by pushing the square cookie cutter straight down over the clay, so that its cross-section is the same square as the cookie cutter. Potter A pushes their cookie cutter down while their clay block is sitting motionless on a table; Potter B pushes their cookie cutter down while their clay block is rotating on a potter's wheel, so their column looks twisted. Which column has greater volume?</p>
