<p>Typically, it is quite difficult to write down a neat closed form  expression for the partial sums of a series.  Geometric series are very notable exceptions to this. Another  family of series for which we can write down partial sums  is called “telescoping series”. These series have the desirable  property that many of the terms in the sum cancel  each other out rendering the partial sums quite simple.</p>
