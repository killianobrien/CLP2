<p>To find the volume of the solid, we cut it into horizontal slices, which are thin circular disks. At height \(y\text{,}\) the disk has radius \(x=\frac{1}{y}\) and thickness \(\dee{y}\text{,}\) so its volume is \(\frac{\pi}{y^2}\dee{y}\text{.}\) The base of the solid is at height \(y=1\text{,}\) and its top is at height \(y=\frac{1}{a}\text{.}\) So, the volume of the entire solid is:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\int_1^{1/a} \frac{\pi}{y^2}\dee{y} = \left[-\frac{\pi}{y}\right]_1^{1/a} = \pi (1-a)
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>If we imagine sliding \(a\) closer and closer to 0, the volume increases, getting closer and closer to \(\pi\) units, but never quite reaching it.</p>
<p>So, the statement is false. For example, if we set \(M=4\text{,}\) no matter which \(a\) we choose our solid has volume strictly less than \(M\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Remark: we've seen before that \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x}\,\dee{x}\) diverges. If we imagine the solid that would result from choosing \(a=0\text{,}\) it would have a scant volume of \(\pi\) cubic units, but a silhouette (side view) of infinite area.</p>
