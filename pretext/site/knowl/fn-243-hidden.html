<body><span class="footnote">Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887) was a German physicist. There are several sets of Kirchhoff's laws that are named after him — Kirchhoff's circuit laws, that we are using in this example, Krichhoff's spectroscopy laws and Kirchhoff's law of thermochemistry. Kirchhoff and his collaborator Robert Bunsen, of Bunsen burner fame, invented the spectroscope.</span></body>
