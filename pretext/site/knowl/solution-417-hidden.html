<p>DefinitionÂ <a knowl="./knowl/def_WKwork.html" title="Definition 2.1.1">2.1.1</a>  in the text is justified by showing that the work done by a force acting on a particle is  equal to the change in the kinetic energy of that particle. We can use Hooke's law to calculate the work done stretching the spring. That work will be equal to the change in kinetic energy of the ball.</p>
<p>The ball initially has kinetic energy \(\frac{1}{2}(1\text{ kg})(v_0 \text{ m/sec})^2 = \frac{v_0^2}{2} \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{sec}^2} = \frac{v_0^2}{2}\text{ J}\text{.}\)  At the time the spring is stretched its farthest, the ball's velocity is 0 m/sec, so its kinetic energy is \(\frac{1}{2}(1\text{ kg})(0 \text{ m/sec})^2 =0 \text{J}\text{.}\) So, the change in kinetic energy of the ball is \(\frac{v_0^2}{2}\) J.</p>
<p>Now let's find the work done by the spring. Its spring constant is \(k=5\) N/m, so, the force on the spring when it is stretched \(x\) metres past its natural length is \(5x\) N. The spring is stretched from its natural length to 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. Then the work done by the spring is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
W&amp;=\int_0^{0.1} kx \dee{x}= \int_0^{0.1} 5x\,\dee{x} = \left[\frac{5}{2}x^2\right]_0^{0.1} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ J}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Now we can find \(v_0\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\frac{v_0^2}{2} =\frac{1}{40} \qquad \implies \qquad v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{20}} \text{ m/sec} \approx 22.36 \text{ cm/sec}
\end{gather*}
