<p>When we studied limits and derivatives, we developed methods for taking limits  or derivatives of “complicated functions” like \(f(x)=x^2 + \sin(x)\) by  understanding how limits and derivatives interact with basic arithmetic  operations like addition and subtraction. This allowed us to reduce the problem  into one of of computing derivatives of simpler functions like \(x^2\) and  \(\sin(x)\text{.}\) Along the way we established  simple rules such as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{x\to a}(f(x)+g(x)) = \lim_{x\to a}f(x) + \lim_{x\to a} g(x)
\quad\text{and}\quad
\diff{}{x}(f(x)+g(x)) = \diff{f}{x} + \diff{g}{x}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>Some of these rules have very natural analogues for integrals and we discuss  them below. Unfortunately the analogous rules for integrals of products of  functions or integrals of compositions of functions are more complicated than  those for limits or derivatives. We discuss those rules at length in subsequent  sections. For now let us consider some of the simpler rules of the arithmetic  of  integrals.</p>
