<p>The integral \(\int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin x\dee{x}\)  is the signed area of the shaded region in the figure on the right below. It naturally splits into  two  regions, one on either side of the \(y\)-axis. We don't know the formula for the  area of  either of these regions (yet), however the two regions are very nearly the same.  In  fact, the part of the shaded region below the \(x\)-axis is exactly the reflection, in the \(x\)-axis, of the part of the shaded region above the \(x\)-axis. So the signed area of part of the shaded region below the \(x\)-axis is the negative of the signed area of part of the shaded region above the \(x\)-axis and</p>
