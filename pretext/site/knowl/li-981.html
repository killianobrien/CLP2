<p>The work in the question is not correct. The most salient problem is that when we make the substitution \(x=\sin\theta\text{,}\) we restrict the possible values of \(x\) to \([-1,1]\text{,}\) since this is the range of the sine function. However, the original integral had no such restriction.</p>
<p>How can we be sure we avoid this problem in the future? In the introductory text to Section <a href="sec_trigsub.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.9: Trigonometric Substitution">1.9</a> (before Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_first_trigsub.html" title="Example 1.9.1: Quarter of the unit circle">1.9.1</a>), the notes tell us that we are allowed to write our old variable as a function of a new variable (say \(x=s(u)\)) <em class="emphasis">as long as that function is invertible to recover our original variable</em> \(x\text{.}\) There is one very obvious reason why invertibility is necessary: after we antidifferentiate using our new variable \(u\text{,}\) we need to get it back in terms of our original variable, so we need to be able to recover \(x\text{.}\) Moreover, invertibility  reconciles  potential problems with domains: if an inverse function \(u=s^{-1}(x)\) exists, then for any \(x\text{,}\) there exists a \(u\) with \(s(u)=x\text{.}\) (This was not the case in the work for the question, because we chose \(x=\sin \theta\text{,}\) but if \(x=2\text{,}\) there is no corresponding \(\theta\text{.}\) Note, however, that \(x=\sin\theta\) is invertible over \([-1,1]\text{,}\)  so the work is correct if we restrict \(x\) to those values.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-9.html#li-981">in-context</a></span>
