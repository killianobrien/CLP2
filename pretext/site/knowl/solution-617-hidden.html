<p>First, we rule out some of the easier tests. The limit of the terms being added is zero, so the divergence test is inconclusive. The terms being added are smaller than the terms of the (divergent) harmonic series, \(\sum \frac{1}{n}\text{,}\) so we can't directly compare these two series, and there isn't another obvious  series to compare ours to. However, the terms being added seem like a function we could integrate.</p>
<p>Let \(\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{5}{x(\log x)^{3/2}}\text{.}\) Then \(f(x)\) is positive and decreases as \(x\) increases. So the sum \(\displaystyle\sum_3^{\infty} f(n)\) and the integral \(\displaystyle\int_3^\infty f(x) \,\dee{x}\) either both converge or both diverge, by the integral test, which is Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_SRintegralTest.html" title="Theorem 3.3.5: The Integral Test">3.3.5</a>. For the integral, we use the substitution \(u = \log x\text{,}\) \(\dee{u} = \frac{\dee{x}}{x}\) to get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\int_3^\infty \frac{5 \,\dee{x}}{x(\log x)^{3/2}} = \int_{\log 3}^\infty \frac{5 \,\dee{u}}{u^{3/2}}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>which converges by the \(p\)-test (which is Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_IMPp1.html" title="Example 1.12.8: \(\int_1^\infty\frac{\dee{x}}{x^p}\) with \(p \gt 0\)">1.12.8</a>) with \(p=\frac{3}{2}  \gt  1\text{.}\)</p>
