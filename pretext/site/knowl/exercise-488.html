<p>Tank \(A\) is in the shape of half a sphere of radius 1 metre, with its flat face resting on the ground, and is completely filled with water. Tank \(B\) is empty and rectangular, with a square base of side length 1 m and a height of 3 m.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:12.5%;margin-right:12.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-438.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>To pump the water from Tank \(A\) to Tank \(B\text{,}\) we need to pump all the water from Tank \(A\) to a height of 3 m. How much work is done to pump all the water from Tank \(A\) to a height of 3 m? You may model the water as a point mass, originally situated at the centre of mass of the full Tank \(A\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Suppose we could move the water from Tank \(A\) directly to its final position in Tank \(B\) without going over the top of Tank \(B\text{.}\) (For example, maybe tank \(A\) is elastic, and Tank \(B\) is just Tank \(A\) after being smooshed into a different form.) How much work is done pumping the water? (That is, how much work is done moving a point mass from the centre of mass of Tank \(A\) to the centre of mass of Tank \(B\text{?}\))</li>
<li>What percentage of work from part (a) was “wasted” by pumping the water over the top of Tank \(B\text{,}\) instead of moving it directly to its final position?</li>
</ol>
<p>You may assume that the only work done is against the acceleration due to gravity, \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\text{,}\) and that the density of water is 1000 kg/m\(^3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Remark: the answer from (b) is what you might think of as the <em class="emphasis">net</em> work involved in pumping the water from Tank \(A\) to Tank \(B\text{.}\) When work gets “wasted,”  the pump does some work pumping water up, then gravity does equal and opposite work bringing the water back down.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-16.html#exercise-488">in-context</a></span>
