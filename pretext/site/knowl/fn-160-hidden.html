<body><span class="footnote">We have discussed the contrapositive a few times  in the CLP notes, but it doesn't hurt to discuss it again here (or for  the reader to quickly look up the relevant footnote in Section 1.3 of  the CLP-1 text).  At any rate, given a statement of the form “If A is true, then B is true”  the contrapositive is “If B is not true, then A is not true”.  The two statements in quotation marks are logically equivalent —  if one is true, then so is the other. In the present context we have “If (\(\sum a_n\) converges)  then  (\(a_n\) converges to \(0\)).” The contrapositive of this statement is then “If   (\(a_n\) does not converge to 0)  then (\(\sum a_n\) does not converge).”</span></body>
