<p>These are listed in TheoremÂ <a knowl="./knowl/thm_SRimportantTaylorSeries.html" title="Theorem 3.6.7">3.6.7</a>. However, it's possible to figure out many of them without a lot of memorization. For example, \(e^0=\cos(0)=\frac{1}{1-0}=1\text{,}\) while \(\sin(0)=\log(1+0)=\arctan(0)=0\text{.}\) So by plugging in \(x=0\) to the series listed, we can divide them into these two categories.</p>
<p>The derivative of sine is cosine, so we can also look for one series that is the derivative of another. The derivative of \(e^x\) is \(e^x\text{,}\) so we can look for a series that is its own derivative.</p>
<p>Furthermore,      sine and arctangent are odd functions and only  II and IV are  odd. Cosine is an even  function and only III is even.</p>
<p>Alternately, we can find the first few terms of each series using the definition of a Taylor series, and match them up.</p>
<p>All together, the functions correspond to the following series:</p>
<p>A - V</p>
<p>B - I</p>
<p>C - IV</p>
<p>D - VI</p>
<p>E - II</p>
<p>F - III</p>
