<p>We can model the sculpture as a collection of thin horizontal plates of width \(\dee{z}\text{.}\) Remember work is force times distance; a horizontal plate at height \(z\) moved \(z+2\) metres from the basement to its final position. So, we need to know the force acting on the plate, which is the product of the mass of the plate with the acceleration due to gravity. Since we are given the density of iron, if we find the volume of the plate, then we can calculate its mass.</p>
