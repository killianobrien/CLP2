<p>For each of the three sets of data points, a straight line has also been plotted “through” the data points. A procedure called linear  regression <a knowl="./knowl/fn-92-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.11.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> has  been used to decide precisely which straight line to plot. It provides a formula for the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the straight  line which “best fits” any given set of data points. From the three lines,  it sure looks like \(k=2\) for the midpoint and trapezoidal rules and  \(k=4\) for Simpson's rule. It also looks like the ratio between the value of \(K\) for the trapezoidal rule,  namely \(K=2^{0.7253}\text{,}\) and the value of \(K\) for the midpoint rule,  namely \(K=2^{-0.2706}\text{,}\) is pretty close to 2:  \(2^{0.7253}/2^{-0.2706}=2^{0.9959}\text{.}\)</p>
