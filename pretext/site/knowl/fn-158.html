</h6>The authors should be a little more careful making such a blanket statement. While it is true that it is not wise to approximate a divergent series by taking \(N\) terms with \(N\) large, there are cases when one can get a very good approximation by taking \(N\) terms with \(N\) small! For example, the Taylor remainder theorem shows us that when the \(n^{\rm th}\) derivative of a function \(f(x)\) grows very quickly with \(n\text{,}\) Taylor polynomials of degree \(N\text{,}\) with \(N\) large, can give bad approximations of \(f(x)\text{,}\) while the Taylor polynomials of degree one or two can still provide very good approximations of \(f(x)\) when \(x\) is very small. As an example of this, one of the triumphs of quantum electrodynamics, namely the computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, depends on precisely this. A number of important quantities were predicted using the first few terms of divergent power series. When those quantities were measured experimentally, the predictions turned out to be incredibly accurate.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-20.html#fn-158">in-context</a></span>
