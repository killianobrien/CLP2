<p>The shape of the earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid, rather than a sphere. An <em class="emphasis">oblate spheroid</em> is formed by rotating an ellipse about its <em class="emphasis">minor axis</em> (its shortest diameter).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Find the volume of the oblate spheroid obtained by rotating the upper (positive) half of the ellipse \((ax)^2+(by)^2=1\) about the \(x\)-axis, where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants with \(a \geq b\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Suppose <a knowl="./knowl/fn-56-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.12"><sup> 12 </sup></a> the earth has radius at the equator of 6378.137  km, and radius at the poles of 6356.752 km. If we model the earth as an oblate spheroid formed by rotating the upper half of the ellipse \((ax)^2+(by)^2=1\) about the \(x\)-axis, what are \(a\) and \(b\text{?}\)</li>
<li>What is the volume of this model of the earth? (Use a calculator.)</li>
<li>Suppose we had calculated the volume of the earth by modelling it as a sphere with radius \(6378.137\) km. What would our absolute and relative errors be, compared to our oblate spheroid calculation?</li>
