<p>We defined \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\text{:}\)  that is, the length of one interval, when we chop \([a,b]\) into \(n\) of them. If \(b\) and \(a\) are measured in metres, then \(\Delta x\) is measured in metres as well. So, the units of \(\Delta x\) are metres.</p>
<p>Put another way, since \(a\) and \(b\) both describe a quantity in metres, \(b-a\) describes a quantity in metres as well. (When we add or subtract quantities of the same units, their sum or difference is given in the same units.) Since \(n\) is a unitless quantity (simply a number: not “\(n\) kg” or “\(n\) m”), \(\frac{b-a}{n}\) still describes a quantity in metres. (If I have 6 metres of cloth, and I cut it into 3 pieces, each piece has \(\frac{6}{3}=2\) metres — not 2 kilograms, or 2 metres per second.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-14.html#li-1540">in-context</a></span>
