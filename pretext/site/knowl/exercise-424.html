<p>The force of gravity between two objects, one of mass \(m_1\) and another of mass \(m_2\text{,}\) is \(F = G\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}\text{,}\) where \(r\) is the distance between them and \(G\) is the gravitational constant.</p>
<p>How much work is required to separate the earth and the moon far enough apart that the gravitational attraction between them is negligible?</p>
<p>Assume the mass of the earth is \(6 \times 10^{24}\) kg and the mass of the moon is \(7 \times 10^{22}\) kg, and that they are currently  \(400\,000\) km away from each other. Also, assume \(G = 6.7\times 10^{-11} \ \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{sec}^2}\text{,}\) and  the only force acting on the earth and moon is the gravity between them.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-14.html#exercise-424">in-context</a></span>
