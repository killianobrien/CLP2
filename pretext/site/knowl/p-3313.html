<p>A mild-mannered university professor who is definitely not a spy notices that when their car is on the ground, it is 2 cm shorter than when it is on a jack. (That is: when the car is on a jack, its struts are at their natural length; when on the ground, the weight of the car causes the struts to compress 2 cm.) The university professor calculates that if they were to jump a local neighborhood drawbridge, their car would fall to the ground with a speed of 4 m/sec. If the car can sag 20 cm before important parts scrape the ground, and the car has mass 2000 kg unoccupied (2100 kg with the professor inside), can the professor, who is certainly not involved in international intrigue, safely jump the  bridge?</p>
