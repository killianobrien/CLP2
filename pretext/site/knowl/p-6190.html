<p><em class="emphasis">Step 2.</em> If (E7) is larger than \(\varepsilon\text{,}\) we divide the original integral \(I=\int_a^b f(x)\,\dee{x}\) into two “half-sized” integrals, \(I_1=\int_a^{\tfrac{a+b}{2}} f(x)\,\dee{x}\) and \(I_2=\int_{\tfrac{a+b}{2}}^b f(x)\,\dee{x}\) and repeat the procedure of Step 1 on each of them, but with \(h\) replaced by \(\tfrac{h}{2}\) and \(\varepsilon\) replaced by \(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\) — if we can find an approximation, \(\tilde I_1\text{,}\) to \(I_1\) with an error less than \(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\) and an approximation, \(\tilde I_2\text{,}\) to \(I_2\) with an error less than \(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\text{,}\) then \(\tilde I_1+\tilde I_2\) approximates \(I\) with an error less than \(\varepsilon\text{.}\) Here is more detail.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>If the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_1\) to \(I_1\) and the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_2\) to \(I_2\) are both acceptable, then we use \(\tilde I_1\) as our final approximation to \(I_1\) and we use \(\tilde I_2\) as our final approximation to \(I_2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_1\) to \(I_1\) is acceptable but the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_2\) to \(I_2\) is not acceptable, then we use \(\tilde I_1\) as our final approximation to \(I_1\) but we subdivide the integral \(I_2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_1\) to \(I_1\) is not acceptable but the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_2\) to \(I_2\) is acceptable, then we use \(\tilde I_2\) as our final approximation to \(I_2\) but we subdivide the integral \(I_1\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_1\) to \(I_1\) and the error in the approximation \(\tilde I_2\) to \(I_2\) are both not acceptable, then we subdivide both of the integrals \(I_1\) and \(I_2\text{.}\)</li>
