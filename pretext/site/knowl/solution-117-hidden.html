<p>Recall that “\(+C\)” means that we can add any constant to the function. Since \(\tan^2 x = \sec^2 x - 1\text{,}\) Students A and B have equivalent answers: they only differ by a constant.</p>
<p>So, if one is right, both are right; if one is wrong, both are wrong. We check Student A's work:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{}{x}\{\tan^2 x + x + C\}=\diff{}{x}\{\tan^2 x\} +1 + 0 = f(x)-1+1=f(x)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, Student A's answer is indeed an anditerivative of \(f(x)\text{.}\) Therefore, <em class="emphasis">both students</em> ended up with the correct answer.</p>
<p>Remark: it is a frequent occurrence that equivalent answers might look quite different. As you are comparing your work to others', this is a good thing to keep in mind!</p>
