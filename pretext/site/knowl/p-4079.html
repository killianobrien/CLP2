<li>Since \(|y| \geq 0\) no matter what \(y\) is, we see \(Cx \ge 0\) for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f(x)\text{.}\) Since \(C\) is positive, that means the domain of \(f(x)\) only includes nonnegative numbers. So, the largest possible domain of \(f(x)\) is \([0,\infty)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>None exists.</p>
<p>The graph of \(Cx\) is given below for some positive constant \(C\text{,}\) also with the graph of \(-Cx\text{.}\) If \(y=f(x)\) were sometimes the top function, and other times the bottom function, then there would be a jump discontinuity where it switched. Then the derivative of \(f(x)\) would not exist, violating the second property.</p>

<p>A tiny technical note is that it's possible that \(f(x)=Cx\) when \(x=0\) and \(f(x)=-Cx\) when \(x \gt 0\) (or vice-versa). This would not introduce a jump discontinuity, but it also does not satisfy that \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some values of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remark: in several instances below, solving a differential equation will lead us to conclude something like \(|y|=g(x)\text{.}\) In these cases, we choose either \(y=g(x)\text{,}\) or \(y=-g(x)\text{,}\) but not \(y=\pm g(x)\) (which is not a function) or that \(y\) is sometimes \(g(x)\text{,}\) and other times \(-g(x)\text{.}\) The reasoning above somewhat explains this choice: if \(y\) were sometimes positive and sometimes negative, then \(\diff{y}{x}\) would not exist at the values of \(x\) where the sign of \(y\) switches, unless that switch occurrs at a root of \(g(x)\text{.}\) Since that's a pretty specific occurrence, we usually feel safe ignoring it to avoid getting bogged down in technical details.</p>
