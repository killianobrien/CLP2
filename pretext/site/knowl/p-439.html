<p>When we gave the formal definition of \(\int_a^b f(x) \dee{x}\) in  Definition <a knowl="./knowl/def_INTintegral.html" title="Definition 1.1.9">1.1.9</a> we explained that the integral could be  interpreted as the signed area between the curve \(y=f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on  the interval \([a,b]\text{.}\) In order for this interpretation to make sense we  required  that \(a \lt b\text{,}\) and though we remarked that the integral makes sense when \(a \gt b\) we  did not explain any further. Thankfully there is an easy way to express the  integral \(\int_a^b f(x)\dee{x}\) in terms of \(\int_b^a f(x)\dee{x}\) — making  it  always possible to write an integral so the lower limit of integration  is less than the upper limit of integration. Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_Intdomain.html" title="Theorem 1.2.3: Arithmetic for the Domain of Integration">1.2.3</a>,  below,  tell us that, for example, \(\int_7^3 e^x\dee{x} = - \int_3^7 e^x\dee{x}\text{.}\) The same theorem also provides us with two other simple manipulations of the limits of  integration.</p>
