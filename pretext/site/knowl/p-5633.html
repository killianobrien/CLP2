<p>In the present context<a knowl="./knowl/fn-215-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.6.23"><sup> 23 </sup></a> we are interested in taking the limit as  \(x \to a\text{.}\)  So we are only interested in \(x\)-values that are  very close to \(a\text{,}\) and because \(c\) lies between \(x\) and \(a\text{,}\)  \(c\) is also very close to \(a\text{.}\) Now, as long as  \(f^{(n+1)}(x)\) is continuous at \(a\text{,}\) as \(x \to a\text{,}\)  \(f^{(n+1)}(c)\) must approach \(f^{(n+1)}(a)\) which is  some finite value. This, in turn,  means that there must be  constants \(M,D \gt 0\) such that \(\big|f^{(n+1)}(c)\big|\le M\)  for all \(c\)'s within a distance \(D\) of \(a\text{.}\) If so, there is  another constant \(C\) (namely \(\tfrac{M}{(n+1)!}\)) such that</p>

\begin{equation*}
\big|E_n(x)\big|\le C |x-a|^{n+1}\qquad\hbox{whenever }|x-a|\le D

<p>There is some notation for this behaviour.</p>
