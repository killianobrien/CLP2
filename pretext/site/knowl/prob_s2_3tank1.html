<p>Tank \(A\) is spherical, of radius 1 metre, and filled completely with water. The bottom of tank \(A\) is three metres above the ground, where Tank \(B\) sits. Tank \(B\) is tall and rectangular, with base dimensions 2 metres by 1 metre, and empty. Calculate the work done by gravity to drain all the water from Tank \(A\) to Tank \(B\) by modelling the situation as a point mass, of the same mass as the water, being moved from the height of the centre of mass of \(A\) to the height of the centre of mass of the water after it has been moved to \(B\text{.}\)</p>

<p>You may use \(1000\) kg/m\(^3\) for the density of water, and \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\) for the acceleration due to gravity.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-16.html#prob_s2_3tank1">in-context</a></span>
