<p>As we have seen, Richardson extrapolation can be used to choose the step size so as to achieve some desired degree of accuracy. We are next going to consider a family of algorithms that extend this idea to use small step sizes in the part of the domain of integration where it is hard to get good accuracy and large step sizes in the part of the domain of integration where it is easy to get good accuracy. We will illustrate the ideas by applying them to the integral \(\int_0^1 \sqrt{x}\ \dee{x}\text{.}\) The integrand \(\sqrt{x}\) changes very quickly when \(x\) is small and changes slowly when \(x\) is large. So we will make the step size small near \(x=0\) and make the step size large near \(x=1\text{.}\)</p>
