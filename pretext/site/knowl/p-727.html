<p>So far, we have been able to guess many antiderivatives. Often, however, antiderivatives are very difficult to guess. In QuestionsÂ <a knowl="./knowl/p1_3_inttablea.html" title="Exercise 1.3.2.16">16</a> through <a knowl="./knowl/p1_3_inttableb.html" title="Exercise 1.3.2.19">19</a>, we will find some antiderivatives that might appear in a table of integrals. Coming up with the antiderivative might be quite difficult (strategies to do just that will form a large part of this semester), but <em class="emphasis">verifying</em> that your antiderivative is correct is as simple as differentiating.</p>
