<li>A <dfn class="terminology">differential equation</dfn> is an equation for an unknown function that contains the derivatives of that unknown function. For example \(y''(t)+y(t)=0\) is a differential equation for the unknown function \(y(t)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>In the differential calculus text CLP-1, we treated only derivatives of functions of one variable. Such derivatives are called ordinary derivatives. A differential equation is called an <dfn class="terminology">ordinary differential equation</dfn> (often shortened to “ODE”) if only ordinary derivatives appear. That is, if the unknown function has only a single independent variable.</p>
<p>In CLP-3 we will treat derivatives of functions of more than one variable. For example, let \(f(x,y)\) be a function of two variables. If you treat \(y\) as a constant and take the derivative of the resulting function of the single variable \(x\text{,}\) the result is called the partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\text{.}\) A differential equation is called a <dfn class="terminology">partial differential equation</dfn> (often shortened to “PDE”) if partial derivatives appear. That is, if the unknown function has more than one independent variable. For example \(y''(t)+y(t)=0\) is an ODE while \(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial\, t^2}(x,t)=c^2
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial\, x^2}(x,t)\) is a PDE.</p>
</li>
<li>The <dfn class="terminology">order</dfn> of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that appears. For example \(y''(t)+y(t)=0\) is a second order ODE.</li>
<li>
<p>An ordinary differential equation that is of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
a_0(t) y^{(n)}(t) + a_1(t) y^{(n-1)}(t)+\cdots +a_n(t)y(t)
=F(t)\tag{B.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>with given coefficient functions \(a_0(t)\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(a_n(t)\) and \(F(t)\) is said to be <dfn class="terminology">linear</dfn>. Otherwise, the ODE is said to be <dfn class="terminology">nonlinear</dfn>. For example, \(y'(t)^2+y(t)=0\text{,}\) \(y'(t)y''(t)+y(t)=0\) and \(y'(t)=e^{y(t)}\) are all nonlinear.</p>
</li>
<li>The ODE <a knowl="./knowl/eqn_ODEordern.html" title="Equation B.2.1">(B.2.1)</a> is said to have <dfn class="terminology">constant coefficients</dfn> if the coefficients  \(a_0(t)\text{,}\) \(a_1(t)\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(a_n(t)\) are all constants. Otherwise, it is said to have <dfn class="terminology">variable coefficients</dfn>. For example, the ODE \(y''(t)+7y(t)=\sin t\) is constant coefficient, while \(y''(t)+ty(t)=\sin t\) is variable coefficient.</li>
<li>The ODE <a knowl="./knowl/eqn_ODEordern.html" title="Equation B.2.1">(B.2.1)</a> is said to be <dfn class="terminology">homogeneous</dfn> if \(F(t)\) is identically zero. Otherwise, it is said to be <dfn class="terminology">inhomogeneous</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">nonhomogeneous</dfn>. For example, the ODE \(y''(t)+7y(t)=0\) is homogeneous, while  \(y''(t)+7y(t)=\sin t\) is inhomogeneous. A homogeneous ODE always has the trivial solution \(y(t)=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>An <dfn class="terminology">initial value problem</dfn>  is a problem in which one is to find an unknown function \(y(t)\) that satisfies both a given ODE and given initial conditions, like \(y(t_0)=1\text{,}\) \(y'(t_0)=0\text{.}\) Note that all of the conditions involve the function \(y(t)\) (or its derivatives) evaluated at a single time \(t=t_0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>A <dfn class="terminology">boundary value problem</dfn>  is a problem in which one is to find an unknown function \(y(t)\) that satisfies both a given ODE and given boundary conditions, like \(y(t_0)=0\text{,}\) \(y(t_1)=0\text{.}\)  Note that the conditions involve the function \(y(t)\) (or its derivatives) evaluated at two different times.</li>
