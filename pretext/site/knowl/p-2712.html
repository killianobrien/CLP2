<p>Notice that in this last example we managed to show that the integral exists by  finding an integrand that behaved the same way for large \(x\text{.}\) Our  intuition then had to be bolstered with some careful inequalities to apply  the comparison Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_IMPcomparison.html" title="Theorem 1.12.17: Comparison">1.12.17</a>. It would be nice to avoid this  last step and be able jump from the intuition to the conclusion without messing  around with inequalities. Thankfully there is a variant of  Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_IMPcomparison.html" title="Theorem 1.12.17: Comparison">1.12.17</a> that is often easier to apply and that also fits  well with the sort of intuition that we developed to solve  Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_IMPp10.html" title="Example 1.12.21: Does \(\int_1^\infty\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^2+x}\dee{x}\) converge?">1.12.21</a>.</p>
