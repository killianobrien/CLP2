<p>(A) Note \(\int f'(x)f(x)\ \dee{x} = \int u\ \dee{u} \) if we substitute \(u=f(x)\text{.}\) This is the kind of integrand described in (I). It's quite possible that a \(u=f(x)\) substitution would work on the others, as well, but (I) is the most reliable kind of integrand for a \(u=f(x)\) substitution.</p>
<p>(B) A trigonometric substitution usually allows us to cancel out a square root containing a quadratic function, as in (IV).</p>
<p>(C) We can often antidifferentiate the product of a polynomial with an exponential function using integration by parts: see ExamplesÂ <a knowl="./knowl/eg_PRTSxex.html" title="Example 1.7.1: \(\int xe^x \dee{x}\)">1.7.1</a>, <a knowl="./knowl/eg_PRTSxtwoex.html" title="Example 1.7.6: \(\int x^2 e^x \dee{x}\)">1.7.6</a>. If we let \(u\) be the polynomial function and \(\dee{v}\) be the exponential, as long as we can antidifferentiate \(\dee{v}\text{,}\) we can repeatedly apply integration by parts until the polynomial function goes away. So, we go with (II)</p>
<p>(D) We apply partial fractions to rational functions, (III).</p>
<p>Note: without knowing more about the functions, there's no guarantee that the methods we chose will be the best methods, or even that they will work (with the exception of (I)).  With practice, you gain intuition about likely methods for different integrals. Luckily for you, there's lots of practice below.</p>
