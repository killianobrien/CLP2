<p>Imagine \(S\) were a solid, of constant density. The the mass of a portion of \(S\) is proportional to the area of that portion. To find the \(x\)-coordinate where the solid would balance, we imagine compressing together the vertical dimension of \(S\) until it's a rod. That is, we would take a very thin vertical strip of \(S\text{,}\) and turn it into a small segment of a rod, with the same mass. Then the centre of mass of that rod would be exactly the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of mass of the solid â€” that is, the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid of \(S\text{.}\)</p>
