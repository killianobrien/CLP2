<p>We have been referring, loosely, to \(\varepsilon\) as the desired rate for introduction of error, by our variable step size method, as \(t\) advances. If the rate of increase of error were exactly \(\varepsilon\text{,}\) then at final time \(t_f\) the accumulated error would be exactly \(\varepsilon(t_f-t_0)\text{.}\) But our algorithm actually chooses the step size \(h\) for each step so that the estimated local truncation error in \(A_{2,n+1}\) for that step is about \(\varepsilon h\text{.}\) We have seen that, once some local truncation error has been introduced, its contribution to the global truncation error can grow exponentially with \(t_f\text{.}\)</p>
