<article class="listitem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Item</span></h6>At this point the idea is clear, just keep going like this. At  the end of each step, the difference between the sum and 1.234 is smaller  than the magnitude of the first unused number in the lists. Since  the numbers in both lists tend to zero as you go farther and farther  up the list, this procedure will generate a series whose sum is  exactly 1.234. Since in each step we remove at least one number from  a list and we alternate between the two lists, the reordered series  will contain all of the terms from \(\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{n}\text{,}\) with each term appearing exactly once.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-53.html#li-2307">in-context</a></span>
