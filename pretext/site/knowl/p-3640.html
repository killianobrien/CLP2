<p>For many (but certainly not all) purposes an (extended rigid) body acts like  a point particle located at its center of mass. For example it is very common to treat the Earth as a point particle. Here is a more detailed example in which we think of a body as being made up of a number of component parts and compute the center of mass of the body as a whole by using the center of masses of the component parts. Suppose that we have a dumbbell  which consists of</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>a left end made up of particles of masses \(m_{l,1}\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(m_{l,3}\) located at \(x_{l,1}\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(x_{l,3}\) and</li>
<li>a right end made up of particles of masses \(m_{r,1}\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(m_{r,4}\) located at \(x_{r,1}\text{,}\) \(\cdots\text{,}\) \(x_{r,4}\) and</li>
<li>an infinitely strong, weightless (idealized) rod joining all of the particles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the mass and center of mass of the left end are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M_l=m_{l,1}+\cdots +m_{l,3}\qquad \bar X_l = \frac{m_{l,1}x_{l,1}+\cdots +m_{l,3}x_{l,3}}{M_l}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the mass and center of mass of the right end are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M_r=m_{r,1}+\cdots +m_{r,4}\qquad \bar X_r = \frac{m_{r,1}x_{r,1}+\cdots +m_{r,4}x_{r,4}}{M_r}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The mass and center of mass of the entire dumbbell are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
M&amp;= m_{l,1}+\cdots +m_{l,3}\  +\  m_{r,1}+\cdots +m_{r,4}\\
&amp;= M_l+M_r\\
\bar x &amp;=\frac{m_{l,1}x_{l,1}+\cdots +m_{l,3}x_{l,3}\ +\
m_{r,1}x_{r,1}+\cdots +m_{r,4}x_{r,4}}{M}\\
&amp;=\frac{M_l \bar X_l + M_r \bar X_r}{M_r+M_l}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So we can compute the center of mass of the entire dumbbell by treating it as being made up of two point particles, one of mass \(M_l\) located at the centre of mass of the left end, and one of mass \(M_r\) located at the center of mass of the right end.</p>
