<p>As was the case for limits, differentiation and antidifferentiation,  we can compute more complicated series in  terms of simpler ones by understanding how series interact  with the usual operations of arithmetic. It is, perhaps,  not so surprising that there are simple rules for addition and subtraction  of series and for multiplication of a series by a constant. Unfortunately  there are no simple general rules for computing products or ratios of series.</p>
