<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{y}{x} = xe^{-y}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is separable, and we now find all of its solutions by using our mnemonic  device. We start by cross-multiplying so as to move all \(y\)'s to the left  hand side and all \(x\)'s to the right hand side.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e^y\,\dee{y} = x\,\dee{x}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then we integrate both sides</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^y\dee{y} = \int x\dee{x} \iff e^y = \frac{x^2}{2}+C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The \(C\) on the right hand side contains both the arbitrary constant  for the indefinite integral \(\int e^y\dee{y}\) and the arbitrary constant for  the indefinite integral  \(\int x\dee{x}\text{.}\) Finally, we solve for \(y\text{,}\)  which is really a function of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = \log\Big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\Big)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Recall that we are using \(\log\) to refer to the natural (base \(e\)) logarithm.</p>
<p>Note that \(C\) is an arbitrary constant. It can take any value. It cannot be determined by the differential equation itself. In applications \(C\) is usually determined by a requirement that \(y\) take some prescribed value (determined by the  application) when \(x\) is some prescribed value. For example, suppose that we wish to find a function \(y(x)\) that obeys both</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{y}{x} = xe^{-y}\qquad\text{and}\qquad y(0)=1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We know that, to have \(\diff{y}{x} = xe^{-y}\) satisfied, we must have  \(y(x) = \log\big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\big)\text{,}\) for some constant \(C\text{.}\) To also have \(y(0)=1\text{,}\) we must have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
1=y(0)=\log\Big(\frac{x^2}{2}+C\Big)\bigg|_{x=0}=\log C \iff \log C =1 \iff C=e
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>So our final solution is \(y(x) = \log\big(\frac{x^2}{2}+e\big)\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
