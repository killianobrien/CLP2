<p>An hourglass is shaped like two identical truncated cones attached together. Their base radius is 5 cm, the height of the entire hourglass is 18 cm, and the radius at the thinnest point is \(.5\) cm. The hourglass contains sand that fills up the bottom 6 cm when it's settled, with mass \(600\) grams and uniform density. We want to know the work done flipping the hourglass smoothly, so the sand settles into a truncated, inverted-cone shape before it starts to fall down.</p>

<p>Using the methods of Section 2.1 to calculate the work done would be quite tedious. Instead, we will model the sand as a point of mass \(0.6\) kg, being lifted from the centre of mass of its original position to the centre of mass of its upturned position. Using the results of QuestionÂ <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_3_cone.html" title="Exercise 2.3.3.29">29</a>, how much work was done on the sand?</p>
<p>To simplify your calculation, you may assume that the height of the upturned sand (that is, the distance from the skinniest part of the hourglass to the top of the sand) is 8.8 cm. (Actually, it's \(\sqrt[3]{937}-1\approx 8.7854\) cm.) So, the top 0.2 cm of the hourglass is empty.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-16.html#prob_s2_3_cone2">in-context</a></span>
