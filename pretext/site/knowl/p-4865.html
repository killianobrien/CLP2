<p>There is another test that is very similar in spirit to the ratio test. It also comes from a reexamination of the  geometric series</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a r^n
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>The ratio test was based on the observation that \(r\text{,}\) which largely determines whether or not the series converges, could be found by  computing the ratio \(r = a_{n+1}/a_n\text{.}\) The root test is based on  the observation that \(|r|\) can also be determined by looking that  the \(n^{\rm th}\) root of the \(n^{\rm th}\) term with \(n\) very large:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\root{n}\of{\big|ar^n\big|}
=|r|\lim_{n\to\infty}\root{n}\of{\big|a\big|}
=|r|\qquad\text{if $a\ne 0$}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Of course, in general, the \(n^{\rm th}\) term is not exactly \(ar^n\text{.}\)  However, if for very large \(n\text{,}\) the \(n^{\rm th}\) term is  approximately proportional to \(r^n\text{,}\) with \(|r|\) given by the above limit, we would expect the series to converge when \(|r| \lt 1\) and diverge when \(|r| \gt 1\text{.}\) That is indeed the case.</p>
