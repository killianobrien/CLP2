<p>Let's first suppose that \(h\) is small enough that the terms \(K'h^{k+1}+K''h^{k+2}+\ \cdots\) in (E1) are small enough<a knowl="./knowl/fn-246-hidden.html" title="Footnote C.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> that dropping them has essentially no impact. This would give</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cA=A(h)+Kh^k
\tag{E2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Imagine that we know \(k\text{,}\) but that we do not know \(A\) or \(K\text{,}\) and think of (E2) as an equation that the unknowns \(\cA\) and \(K\) have to solve. It may look like we have one equation in the two unknowns \(K\text{,}\) \(\cA\text{,}\) but that is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the case. The reason is that (E2) is (essentially) true for all (sufficiently small) choices of \(h\text{.}\) If we pick some \(h\text{,}\) say \(h_1\text{,}\) and use the algorithm to determine \(A(h_1)\) then (E2), with \(h\) replaced by \(h_1\text{,}\) gives one equation in the two unknowns \(\cA\) and \(K\text{,}\) and if we then pick some different \(h\text{,}\) say \(h_2\text{,}\) and use the algorithm a second time to determine \(A(h_2)\) then (E2), with \(h\) replaced by \(h_2\text{,}\) gives a second equation in the two unknowns \(\cA\) and \(K\text{.}\) The two equations will then determine both \(\cA\) and \(K\text{.}\)</p>
