<p>Here is another application of the Definition <a knowl="./knowl/def_AVaverage.html" title="Definition 2.2.2">2.2.2</a> of the average value of a function on an interval. The following theorem can be  thought of as an analogue of the mean value theorem (which was covered in your  differential calculus class) but for integrals. The theorem says that a  continuous function \(f(x)\) must be exactly equal to its average value for some \(x\text{.}\) For example, if you  went for a drive along the \(x\)-axis and you were at \(x(a)\) at time \(a\) and at \(x(b)\) at  time \(b\text{,}\) then your velocity \(x'(t)\) had to be exactly your average velocity \(\frac{x(b)-x(a)}{b-a}\) at some time \(t\) between \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) In particular, if your average velocity was greater than the speed limit, you were definitely speeding at some point during the trip. This is, of course, no great surprise<a knowl="./knowl/fn-128-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>.</p>
