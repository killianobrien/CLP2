<p>Before we do so, let's think about the sign in equation (<a knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 2.4.8: Radioactive decay">2.4.8</a>).</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Recall that \(Q(t)\) denotes a quantity, namely the amount  of \({}^{14}C\) present at time \(t\text{.}\) There cannot be a negative amount of \({}^{14}C\text{.}\)  Nor can this quantity be zero. (We would not use carbon dating  when there is no \({}^{14}C\) present.)  Consequently, \(Q(t) \gt  0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>As the time \(t\) increases, \(Q(t)\) decreases, because \({}^{14}C\) is being continuously converted into \({}^{14}N\) by radioactive decay <a knowl="./knowl/fn-134-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. Thus \(\diff{Q}{t}(t) \lt  0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The signs \(Q(t) \gt  0\) and \(\diff{Q}{t}(t) \lt  0\) are consistent with (<a knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 2.4.8: Radioactive decay">2.4.8</a>) provided the constant of  proportionality \(k \gt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>In (<a knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 2.4.8: Radioactive decay">2.4.8</a>), we chose to call the constant of proportionality “\(-k\)”. We did so in order to make \(k \gt 0\text{.}\) We could just as well have chosen to call the constant of proportionality “\(K\)”.  That is, we could have replaced  equation (<a knowl="./knowl/eq_carbonDating.html" title="Equation 2.4.8: Radioactive decay">2.4.8</a>) by \(\diff{Q}{t}(t)=K Q(t)\text{.}\) The constant of proportionality \(K\) would have to be negative, (and \(K\) and \(k\) would be related by  \(K=-k\)).</li>
