<p>In order to apply the substitution rule successfully we will have to write the integrand  in the form \(f(u(x))\cdot u'(x)\text{.}\) To do this we need to make a good choice of the  function \(u(x)\text{;}\) after that it is not hard to then find \(f(u)\) and \(u'(x)\text{.}\)   Unfortunately there is no one strategy for choosing \(u(x)\text{.}\) This can make applying the  substitution rule more art than science <a knowl="./knowl/fn-38-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. Here we suggest two possible strategies for picking \(u(x)\text{:}\)</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Factor the integrand and choose one of the factors to be \(u'(x)\text{.}\) For this to work,  you must be able to easily find the antiderivative of the chosen factor. The  antiderivative will be \(u(x)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Look for a factor in the integrand that is a function with an argument that is more  complicated than just “\(x\)”. That factor will play the role of \(f\big(u(x)\big)\) Choose  \(u(x)\) to be the complicated argument.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are two examples which illustrate each of those strategies in turn.</p>
