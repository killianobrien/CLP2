<p>We also remark that this is a demonstration of the usefulness of integrals. We wanted to know how much of <em class="emphasis">something</em> there was, but the amount of that something was different everywhere: more in some places, less in others. Integration allowed us to account for this gradient. You've seen this behaviour exploited to find distances travelled, areas, volumes, and now mass. In your studies, you will doubtless learn to use it to find still more  quantities, and we will discuss other applications in ChapterÂ <a href="chap_int_app.html" class="xref" title="Chapter 2: Applications of Integration">2</a>.</p>
