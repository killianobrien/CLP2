<p>If \(p(t)\) is the proportion of times speakers use the new form, measured between 0 and 1, then \(1-p(t)\) is the proportion of times speakers use the old form.</p>
<p>The law, then, states that \(\diff{p}{t}\) is proportional to \(p(t)\times \big(1-p(t)\big)\text{.}\) When we say two quantities are proportional, we mean that one is a constant multiple of the other. So, the law says</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{p}{t}=\alpha p(t)\big(1-p(t)\big)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for some constant \(\alpha\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Remark: it follows from this model that, when a new form is either very rare or entirely ubiquitous, the rate of change of its adoption is small. This makes sense: if the new form is used all the time (\(p(t)\approx 1\)), there's nobody left to convert; if the new form is almost never used (\(p(t)\approx 0\)) then people don't know about it, so they won't pick it up.</p>
