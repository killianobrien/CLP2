<p>In general the ratio of successive terms of a series,  \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\text{,}\) is not constant, but depends on  \(n\text{.}\) However, as we have noted above, the convergence of a  series \(\sum a_n\) is determined by the behaviour of its  terms when \(n\) is large. In this way, the behaviour of this  ratio when \(n\) is small tells us nothing about the  convergence of the series, but the limit of the ratio as \(n\to\infty\) does. This is the basis of the ratio test.</p>
