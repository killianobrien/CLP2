<p>Of course, representing a function as simple as \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) by a series  doesn't seem like it is going to make life easier. However the idea of  representing a function by a series turns out to be extremely helpful.  Power series turn out to be very robust mathematical objects and  interact very nicely with not only standard arithmetic operations,  but also with differentiation and integration (see Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_SRpsops.html" title="Theorem 3.5.13: Operations on Power Series">3.5.13</a>).  This means, for example, that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\diff{}{x} \left\{\frac{1}{1-x}\right\}
&amp;= \diff{}{x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n &amp; \text{provided $|x| \lt 1$}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \diff{}{x} x^n  &amp; \text{just differentiate term by term}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^\infty n x^{n-1}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">and in a very similar way</p>
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{1}{1-x} \dee{x} &amp;= \int \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n \dee{x} &amp; \text{provided $|x| \lt 1$}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int x^n \dee{x}  &amp; \text{just integrate term by term}\\
&amp;= C + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We are hiding some mathematics under the word “just” in the above,  but you can see that once we have a power series representation of  a function, differentiation and integration become very straightforward.</p>
