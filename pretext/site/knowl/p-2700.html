<p>For pedagogical purposes, we are going to concentrate on the problem of  determining whether or not an integral \(\int_a^\infty f(x)\dee{x}\) converges,  when \(f(x)\) has no singularities for \(x\ge a\text{.}\) Recall that the first step in  analyzing any improper integral is to write it as a sum of integrals each of has  only a single “source of impropriety” — either a domain of integration that  extends to \(+\infty\text{,}\) or a domain of integration that extends to \(-\infty\text{,}\) or  an integrand which is singular at one end of the domain of integration. So we  are now going to consider only the first of these three possibilities. But the  techniques that we are about to see have obvious analogues for the other two  possibilities.</p>
