<body><div class="solution"><p>Sketch the mercury in the tank at time \(t\text{,}\)  when it has height \(h\text{,}\) and also at time \(t+\dee{t}\text{,}\) when it has height \(h+\dee{h}\) (with \(\dee{h} \lt 0\)). The difference between those two volumes is the volume of (essentially) a disk of thickness \(-\dee{h}\text{.}\) Figure out the radius and then the volume of that disk. This volume has to be the same as the volume of mercury that left through the hole in the bottom of the sphere, which runs out in the shape of a cylinder. Toricelli's law tells you what the length of that cylinder is, and from there you can find its volume. Setting the two volumes equal to each other gives the differential equation that determines \(h(t)\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
