<body><span class="footnote">Of course, this  assumes that you did your differential calculus course last term. If you did that course  at a different time then please think back to that point in time. If it is long enough  ago that you don't quite remember when it was, then you should probably do some revision  of derivatives of simple functions before proceeding further.</span></body>
