<p>An investor places some money in a mutual fund where the interest is compounded continuously and where the interest rate fluctuates between \(4\%\) and \(8\%\text{.}\) Assume that the amount of money \(B=B(t)\) in the account in dollars after \(t\) years satisfies the differential equation</p>

<p>An endowment is an investment account in which the balance ideally remains constant and withdrawals are made on the interest earned by the account. Such an account may be modeled by the initial value problem \(B'(t) = aB - m\) for \(t \ge 0\text{,}\) with \(B(0) = B_0\) . The constant \(a\) reflects the annual interest rate, \(m\) is the annual rate of withdrawal, and \(B_0\) is the initial balance in the account.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Solve the initial value problem with \(a = 0.02\) and \(B(0) = B_0 = \$30,000\text{.}\) Note that your answer depends on the constant \(m\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(a = 0.02\) and \(B(0) = B_0 = \$30,000\text{,}\) what is the annual withdrawal rate \(m\) that ensures a constant balance in the account?</li>

<p>A tank 2 m tall is to be made with circular cross--sections with radius \(r=y^p\text{.}\) Here \(y\) measures the vertical distance from the bottom of the tank and \(p\) is a positive constant to be determined. You may assume that when the tank drains, it obeys Torricelli's law, that is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
A(y)\diff{y}{t}=-c\sqrt{y}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>for some constant \(c\) where \(A(y)\) is the cross--sectional area of the tank at height \(y\text{.}\) It is desired that the tank be constructed so that the top half (\(y=2\) to \(y=1\)) takes exactly the same amount of time to drain as the bottom half (\(y=1\) to \(y=0\)). Determine the value of \(p\) so that the tank has this property. <em class="emphasis">Note:</em> it is not possible or necessary to find \(c\) for this question.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">
