<body><span class="footnote">Newton published his inverse square law of  universal gravitation in his Principia in 1687. His law states that the  gravitational force between two masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) is \(F = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\) where \(r\) is the distance separating the (centres of the) masses and \(G=  6.674\times 10^{-11} \mathrm{N}\mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{kg}^2\) is the gravitational constant.  Notice that \(r\) measures the separation between the centres of the masses not the  distance between the surfaces of the objects. Also, do not confuse \(G\) with \(g\) — standard acceleration due to gravity. The first  measurement of \(G\) was performed by Henry Cavendish in 1798 — the interested reader  should look up the “Cavendish experiment” for details of this very impressive work.</span></body>
