<li>Suppose the sequence \(\{w_1,w_2,w_3,\ldots\}\) is a list of all words in a language, where \(w_n\) is the word that is the \(n\)th most frequently used. Let \(f_n\) be the frequency of word \(w_n\text{.}\) Is \(\{f_1,f_2,f_3,\ldots\}\) an increasing sequence or a decreasing sequence?</li>
<li>Give a general formula for \(f_n\text{,}\) treating \(f_1\) as a constant.</li>
<li>Suppose in a language, \(w_1\) (the most frequently used word) has frequency \(6\%\text{.}\) If the language follows Zipf's Law, then what frequency does \(w_3\) have?</li>
<li>Suppose \(f_6=0.3\%\) for a language following Zipf's law. What is \(f_{10}\text{?}\)</li>
<li>The word “the” is the most-used word in contemporary American English. In a collection of about 450 million words, “the” appeared 22,038,615 times. The second-most used word is “be,” followed by “and.” About how many usages of these words do you expect in the same collection of 450 million words?</li>
