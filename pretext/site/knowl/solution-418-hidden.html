<p>The setup to answer this question is similar to QuestionÂ <a knowl="./knowl/prob_s2_1_Work_KE.html" title="Exercise 2.1.2.18">18</a> in this section: the work done by a spring on the occupied vehicle will be equal to the change in kinetic energy of that occupied vehicle. So, we need to find the work done by the spring, and the kinetic energy lost by the falling car. In order to find the work done by the spring, we need to find the spring constant.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Spring constant: The car's mass of 2000 kg compresses the struts 2 cm past their natural length. The force of the car under gravity is \((2000 \text{ kg})\times(9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2) = 19\,600 \) N. This force is exactly the same as that exerted by the   spring, \(k(0.02 \text{ m})\text{.}\) So, \(k = 980\,000\) N/m.</li>
<li>Work done by spring: The spring can safely compress 20 cm. So, the amount of work done by the spring compressing that far gives us the <em class="emphasis">maximum</em> amount of work the spring can safely do. While the car is falling, the spring is at its natural length, so the work done to compress it to 20 cm (0.2 m) shorter is:<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{0.2} kx\,\dee{x} = \int_0^{0.2} 980\,000 x\,\dee{x} =\big[490\,000 x^2 \big]_0^{0.2}=19\,600 \text{ J}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>Change in kinetic energy: When the car first hits the pavement, it's falling at \(4\) m/sec, so it has kinetic energy \(\frac{1}{2}(2100\text{ kg})(4\text{ m/sec})^2 = 16\,800\) J. When the car compresses the springs as far as they go and it starts to rebound, it has kinetic energy 0, since its instantaneous velocity is zero. So, the change in kinetic energy is \(16\,800\) J.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the change in kinetic energy is \(16\,800\) J, and the struts can safely do a work of (up to) \(19\,600\) J, the jump is within the (meagre) safety limits set by the question.</p>
