<p>If \(F(x)\) is even, then \(f(x)\) is odd (by the result of Question <a knowl="./knowl/p1_2_derivevenodd.html" title="Exercise 1.2.3.20">1.2.3.20</a> in Section <a href="sec_def_int.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.2: Basic properties of the definite integral">1.2</a>). So, \(F(x)\) can only be even if \(f(x)\) is both even and odd. By the result in Question <a knowl="./knowl/p1_1_bothevenodd.html" title="Exercise 1.2.3.19">1.2.3.19</a>, Section <a href="sec_def_int.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.2: Basic properties of the definite integral">1.2</a>, this means \(F(x)\) is only even if \(f(x)=0\) for all \(x\text{.}\) Note if \(f(x)=0\text{,}\) then \(F(x)\) is a constant function. So, it is certainly even, and it might be odd as well if \(F(x)=f(x)=0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Therefore, if \(f(x) \neq 0\) for some \(x\text{,}\) then \(F(x)\) is not even. It could be odd, or it could be neither even nor odd. We can come up with examples of both types: if \(f(x)=1\text{,}\) then \(F(x)=x\) is an odd antiderivative, and \(F(x)=x+1\) is an antiderivative that is neither even nor odd.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the antiderivative of an odd function is always even. The proof is a little beyond what we might ask you, but is given below for completeness. The proof goes like this: First, we'll show that if \(g(x)\) is odd, then there is <em class="emphasis">some</em> antiderivative of \(g(x)\) that is even. Then, we'll show that <em class="emphasis">every</em> antiderivative of \(g(x)\) is even.</p>
<p>So, suppose \(g(x)\) is odd and define \(G(x)=\displaystyle\int_0^x g(t)\dee{t}\text{.}\) By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1, \(G'(x)=g(x)\text{,}\) so \(G(x)\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x)\text{.}\) Since \(g(x)\) is odd, for any \(x\ge 0\text{,}\) the net signed area under the curve along \([0,x]\) is the <em class="emphasis">negative</em> of the net signed area under the curve along \([-x,0]\text{.}\) So,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int_0^x g(t)\dee{}t &amp;= - \int_{-x}^0 g(t)\dee{t}&amp;\quad(\mbox{See Example }\knowl{./knowl/eg_areaunderoddfunction.html}{\text{1.2.11}})\\
&amp;=\int_0^{-x} g(t)\dee{t}\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">By the definition of \(G(x)\text{,}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
G(x)&amp;=G(-x)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>That is, \(G(x)\) is even. We've shown that there exists <em class="emphasis">some</em> antiderivative of \(g(x)\) that is even; it remains to show that <em class="emphasis">all of them</em> are even.</p>
<p>Recall that every antiderivative of \(g(x)\) differs from \(G(x)\) by some constant. So, any antiderivative of \(g(x)\)  can be written as \(G(x)+C\text{,}\) and  \(G(-x)+C = G(x)+C\text{.}\) So, every antiderivative of an odd function is even.</p>
