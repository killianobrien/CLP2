<body><span class="footnote">Very wrong. But it is not an example of  “not even wrong” — which is a phrase attributed to the physicist Wolfgang Pauli who  was known for his harsh critiques of sloppy arguments. The phrase is typically  used to describe arguments that are so incoherent that not only can one  not prove they are true, but they lack enough coherence to be able to  show they are false. The interested reader should do a little searchengineing  and look at the concept of falisfyability.</span></body>
