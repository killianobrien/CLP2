<p>A variable force \(F(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{x}}\) Newtons moves an object along a straight line when it is a distance of \(x\) meters from the origin.

<p>A sculpture, shaped like a pyramid \(3\)m high sitting on the ground, has been made by stacking smaller and smaller (very thin) iron plates on top of one another. The iron plate at height \(z\) m above ground level is a square whose side length is \((3-z)\) m. All of the iron plates started on the floor of a basement \(2\) m below ground level.</p>
<p>Write down an integral that represents the work, in joules, it took to move all of the iron from its starting position to its present position. Do <em class="alert">not</em> evaluate the integral. (You can use \(9.8\) m\({}/{}\)s\({}^2\) for the acceleration due to gravity and \(8000\)  kg\({}/{}\)m\({}^3\) for the density of iron.)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>A box is dragged along the floor. Friction exerts a force in the opposite direction of motion from the box, and that force is equal to \(\mu \times m \times g\text{,}\) where \(\mu\) is a constant, \(m\) is the mass of the box and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. You may assume \(g=9.8\) m/sec\(^2\text{.}\)</p>

<p>A ball of mass 1 kg is attached to a spring, and the spring is attached to a table. The ball moves with some initial velocity, and the spring slows it down. At its farthest, the spring stretches 10 cm past its natural length. If the spring constant is 5 N/m, what was the initial velocity of the ball?</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:35%;margin-right:35%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-345.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>You may assume that the ball starts moving with initial velocity \(v_0\text{,}\) and that the only force slowing it down is the spring. You may also assume that the spring started out at its natural length, it follows Hooke's law, and when it is stretched its farthest, the velocity of the ball is 0 m/sec.</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>A mild-mannered university professor who is definitely not a spy notices that when their car is on the ground, it is 2 cm shorter than when it is on a jack. (That is: when the car is on a jack, its struts are at their natural length; when on the ground, the weight of the car causes the struts to compress 2 cm.) The university professor calculates that if they were to jump a local neighborhood drawbridge, their car would fall to the ground with a speed of 4 m/sec. If the car can sag 20 cm before important parts scrape the ground, and the car has mass 2000 kg unoccupied (2100 kg with the professor inside), can the professor, who is certainly not involved in international intrigue, safely jump the  bridge?</p>
<p>Assume the car falls vertically, the struts obey Hooke's law, and the work done by the struts is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the car + professor. Use 9.8 m/sec\(^2\) for  the acceleration due to gravity.</p></article>
